# The Amateur's Code

by Paul M. Segal, W9EEA (1928)

## The Radio Amateur is:

* **Considerate** never knowingly operating in such a way as to lessen the
pleasure of others

* **Loyal** offering loyalty, encouragement and support to other amateurs,
local clubs and the American Radio Relay League, through which
Amateur Radio in the United States is represented nationally and
internationally

* **Progressive** with knowledge abreast of science, a well built and
efficient station, and operation beyond reproach

* **Friendly** with slow and patient operation when requested, friendly
advice and counsel to the beginner, kindly assistance, co-operation and
consideration for the interests of others. These are the hallmarks of
the amateur spirit

* **Balanced** ... Radio is an avocation, never interfering with duties
owed to family, job, school or community

* **Patriotic** with station and skill always ready for service to country and
community
