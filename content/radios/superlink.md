SuperLINK was an Amateur Radio repeater linking system connecting together
2 meter repeaters located along Interstate 94 from the Western Border of
North Dakota, through Minnesota, and into Wisconsin. It also had links
extending north to Winnipeg, Canada.

SuperLINK is reportedly no longer operational.

Amateur Radio Operators interested in internet linked analog VHF/UHF radios may wish
