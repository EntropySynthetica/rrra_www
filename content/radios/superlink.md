## What is SuperLINK?

SuperLINK is an operator controlled Amateur Radio repeater linking
system connecting 2 meter repeaters located along Interstate
94 from the Western Border of North Dakota, through Minnesota and into
Wisconsin. It also has links which go north to Winnipeg, Canada.

The SuperLINK linking system requires that the user turn **on** the
*linking system* of their local 2 meter repeater and then select where
the linked signal will come out of the system. This *selection* is done
by the system user sending out two 3 digit DTMF codes. A voice
announcement will tell you when you have successfully completed the
linking.

## Rules of Operation

1. Remember the priority of traffic on the linking system. Emergency
(#1), weather (#2), and general conversation.
2. Be sure you turn **off** what you turn **on**. Turn **off** the links
in the reverse order you turned them **on**, so that you can listen for
the voice announcements to tell you when each has been cleared.
3. Be sure you leave time (1 or 2 seconds), after keying your
transmitter, for the system to come up before you start talking or
sending DTMF node codes.

## SuperLINK Instructions

### Accessing SuperLINK
1. Access the 2 meter repeater in you local area and ID.
2. Indicate your intentions of accessing the SuperLINK.
3. Enter the node code for your local repeater using your DTMF pad.
4. **Listen** to hear the link acknowledge your access.
5. **Listen** for anybody else using the SuperLINK.
6. If the link is clear, enter the node code for the destination repeater.
7. **Listen** to hear the link acknowledge your access to the destination
repeater.
8. **Listen** for anybody using the destination repeater.
9. If the destination repeater is clear then make your call.
10. **Wait** about 2 seconds before talking each time you key your mic. This
will allow the link to connect all nodes used in your communication.

### Leaving the SuperLINK
1. Key in the number 1 and then the node code for the destination repeater.
2. **Listen** to hear the destination repeater acknowledge your request.
3. Key in the number 1 and then the node code for your repeater.
4. **Listen** to hear your repeater acknowledge your request.

### How to dial Node Codes

Node codes are *dialed* by transmitting the first three digits of that city
using your transceiver's DTMF keypad. For example: BISmarck = 247,
ALExandria = 253.

### Exceptions

#### Barnesville Hotlink

The Barnesville Hotlink is a cluster of 3 permanently links repeaters
connected to SuperLINK:

* Barnsville
* Fischer
* Karlstad

The Barnesville Hotlink node code is 327, for FAR (Fargo). This
is because BAR would conflict with CAR (Carrington) which is 227.

#### Winnepeg

Winnipeg is not a traditional SuperLINK node, but rather a *dial up*
extension of the Barnsville *Hotlink*. Winnipeg acts differently than the
rest of the system.

* **From any of the [Barnesville Hotlink](#barnesville-hotlink) systems** 
enter 946 (WIN) to enable the Winnipeg link.

* **From any other SuperLINK node** follow the standard connection
procedure (documented below) to enable the link from your repeater to
the Barnesville Hotlink, and **then** enter 946 (WIN) to enable the
Winnipeg link.

Also note that the disconnect code for the Winnepeg link is 947 and
