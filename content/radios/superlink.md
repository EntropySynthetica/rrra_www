# What is SuperLink?

SuperLINK is a Amateur Radio repeater linking system that links together 2
meter repeaters located along Interstate 94 from the Western Border of North
Dakota, through Minnesota and into Wisconsin. It also has links that go north
to Winnipeg, Canada.
<!--more-->
The SuperLINK linking system requires that the user turn **on** the "linking
system" of their local 2 meter repeater and then select where the linked
signal will come out of the system. This "selection" is done by the system
user sending out two 3 digit touch-tone codes. A voice announcement will tell
you when you have successfully completed the linking.

# How To Dial Node Codes

If you know where there is a node (city) then you dial it up by entering the
first three digits if that city like as you would on a telephone keypad. i.e.:
Bismarck... BIS or 247, or Alexandria... ALE or 253.

## Exceptions

* Barnsville, which is actually 327, for FAR (Fargo). The reason for this
is that BAR would conflict with CAR (Carrington) which is 227.
* Winnipeg is not a traditional SuperLINK node, but rather a "dial up"
node from the Barnsville "Hotlink". Winnipeg acts differently than the
rest of the system. If you are on the Barnsville, Fischer, or Karlstad
repeater, you only need enter 946 (WIN) to bring Winnipeg up. There
is no need to bring up 327... HOWEVER.. say you are in Bismarck and
you want Winnipeg, you would have to bring up 247, 327, and then 946,
as Winnipeg is part of the Barnsville "Hotlink", and not the regular
SuperLINK. Another difference with Winnipeg is that you enter 947 to
bring it down, instead of adding the digit 1 to close it as you would
the other nodes.

## Rules of Operation

1. Remember the priority of traffic on the linking system. Emergency (#1),
weather (#2), and general conversation.
2. Be sure you turn **off** what you turn **on**. Turn **off** the links in the reverse
order you turned them **on**, so that you can listen for the voice announcements
to tell you when each has been cleared.
3. Be sure you leave time (1 or 2 seconds), after keying your transmitter, for
the system to come up before you start talking or sending your access code
touch tones.

# SuperLINK Instructions

## Accessing SuperLINK
1. Access the 2 meter repeater in you local area and ID.
2. Indicate your intentions of accessing the SuperLINK.
3. Key in the code for your local repeater using the tone pad.
4. **Listen** to hear the link acknowledge your access.
5. **Listen** for anybody else using the SuperLINK.
6. If the link is clear, key in the code for the destination repeater.
7. **Listen** to hear the link acknowledge your access to the destination
repeater.
8. **Listen** for anybody using the destination repeater.
9. If the destination repeater is clear then make your call.
10. **Wait** about 2 seconds before talking each time you key your mic. This
will allow the link to connect all nodes used in your communication.
