## What the FCC Wants to Hear About (Cares About)

The following was written for FCC Docket 24-240 but is germane to FCC
Docket 25-133.

>A trusted advisor provided me with this short, pithy, realistic, and a
>bit brutal "reality check" list of the real priorities of the FCC in
>considering issues such as Docket 24-240:
>
>* Innovation
>* Creating new tax paying businesses
>* Unserved and underserved populations
>    * Native Americans
>    * People with disabilities
>    * Schoolchildren
>* Emergency communications
>* Broadband communications
>* Revenue to the US government (spectrum auctions)
>* Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) [^4]
>* National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) [^5]
>
>This adviser consistently offers "distilled wisdom" on matters
>relating to the FCC, and I am very grateful for his input such as this.
>
>To this adviser’s points, I would add:
>
>* Addressing the shortage of the Spectrum Workforce as outlined
>in the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy
>(https://www.ntia.gov/issues/national-spectrum-strategy) to expand the
>workforce of of those knowledgeable about radio technology to create
>new radio technology systems and build and maintain radio technology
>systems.
>* STEM education (we need more techies, not just programmers)
>* US national and regional security, including (radio systems)
>cybersecurity
>* US national economic activity / impact (not necessarily just paying
>taxes)
>
>Note that "hobbyist" activity such as "playing around with
>Meshtastic" or "chatting on an Amateur Radio repeater" does not
>appear on the above list. Such activities are simply not on the FCC’s
>"cares about" list. But using Meshtastic to encourage STEM and Maker
>activities by students and youth, or Amateur Radio repeaters to provide
>emergency and "no dependence on cellular, Internet, or satellite"
>communications is something that the FCC "cares about". [^1]

[^4]: CTIA is the industry association for the "cellular" industry. Their inputs and requirements are a priority with the FCC. I haven’t seen any mention that Docket 24-240 is of interest to them.

[^5]: NAB is the industry association from the broadcasting industry. Their inputs and requirements are also a priority with the FCC. There is some relevance to television broadcasting relating to Docket 24-240 that ATSC 3.0 technology can provide alternative PNT services to NextNav’s PNT services.
