### What the FCC Wants to Hear About {#fcc}

#### From FCC Docket 25-133 

>We encourage commenters to consider certain policy factors, as
>described below and consistent with standards and objectives set forth
>in recent Presidential orders as well as statutory and regulatory
>retrospective review standards. We also invite more general comment on
>rules that should be considered for elimination on other grounds [^2]

* Cost-benefit considerations
* Experience gained from the implementation of the rule.
* Marketplace and technological changes.
* Regulation as barrier to entry
* Changes in the broader regulatory context
* Changes in, or other implications of, the governing legal framework
* Other considerations relevant to the retrospective review of
Commission rules

Explanations of these bullet points start on page 2 of [FCC Docket
25-133][25-133].

#### From Zero Retries 0168

The following was written for FCC Docket 24-240 but is germane to FCC
Docket 25-133.

>A trusted advisor provided me with this short, pithy, realistic, and a
>bit brutal "reality check" list of the real priorities of the FCC in
>considering issues such as Docket 24-240:
>
>* Innovation
>* Creating new tax paying businesses
>* Unserved and underserved populations
>    * Native Americans
>    * People with disabilities
>    * Schoolchildren
>* Emergency communications
>* Broadband communications
>* Revenue to the US government (spectrum auctions)
>* Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) [^4]
>* National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) [^5]
>
>This adviser consistently offers "distilled wisdom" on matters
>relating to the FCC, and I am very grateful for his input such as this.
>
>To this adviser’s points, I would add:
>
>* Addressing the shortage of the Spectrum Workforce as outlined
>in the Biden-Harris Administration’s National Spectrum Strategy
>(https://www.ntia.gov/issues/national-spectrum-strategy) to expand the
>workforce of of those knowledgeable about radio technology to create
>new radio technology systems and build and maintain radio technology
>systems.
>* STEM education (we need more techies, not just programmers)
>* US national and regional security, including (radio systems)
>cybersecurity
>* US national economic activity / impact (not necessarily just paying
>taxes)
>
>Note that "hobbyist" activity such as "playing around with
>Meshtastic" or "chatting on an Amateur Radio repeater" does not
>appear on the above list. Such activities are simply not on the FCC’s
>"cares about" list. But using Meshtastic to encourage STEM and Maker
>activities by students and youth, or Amateur Radio repeaters to provide
>emergency and "no dependence on cellular, Internet, or satellite"
>communications is something that the FCC "cares about". [^3]

[^4]: CTIA is the industry association for the "cellular" industry. Their inputs and requirements are a priority with the FCC. I haven’t seen any mention that Docket 24-240 is of interest to them.

[^5]: NAB is the industry association from the broadcasting industry. Their inputs and requirements are also a priority with the FCC. There is some relevance to television broadcasting relating to Docket 24-240 that ATSC 3.0 technology can provide alternative PNT services to NextNav’s PNT services.
