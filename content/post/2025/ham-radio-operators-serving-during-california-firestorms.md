As the firestorms across Southern California continue to threaten
millions of residents, trained amateur radio operators are serving
critical volunteer roles to help officials spot fires before they get
out of control. Dry conditions and wind gusts of 100 miles per hour have
fueled days of devastating wildfires. Entire neighborhoods have been
leveled by infernos.

The Eaton fire burned to the top of Mount Wilson, a critical
logistical post for broadcast radio and television stations, as well
as communications across the Southland. Federal agencies, air traffic
control, local emergency responders, radio amateurs, and others all
share tower space on the mountain.

While the main fires have been burning north and northwest of the
central section of Los Angeles, just to the south, hams are standing
watch. [Orange County Fire Watch \(OCFW\)][OCFW] is a program locally
organized by the Orange County Parks Department and the Irvine
Conservancy.

During severe fire weather, volunteers go to preassigned locations
within parks and open spaces to report conditions. Many of them are
hams, using the amateur radio bands to fill in mobile network weak
zones.  [ARRL National Instructor Gordon West, WB6NOA][gordo],
is among the deployed volunteers. He said hams are stepping up. "We’re
all over the [ARRL Orange Section][orange] on hilltops, reporting the
wind and humidity, ash seen coming down, scanning for spot fires (none
so far), smoke from the LA fires, guest activity at the parks, and
being a presence at trailheads with reflective vests and vehicle signs
indicating Fire Watch," he said.

Ray Hutchinson, AE6H, is a retired Firefighter who serves as the
chief radio officer for Fire Watch. He says local clubs are key to
providing the needed RF infrastructure. "Our local club, the
[South Orange Amateur Radio Association \(SOARA\)][SOARA], an ARRL
Special Service Club, provides linked 2-meter and 70-centimeter
repeaters: one high level and one coastal, for use by OCFW hams during
deployments. There is a formal OCFW Net Control Station (NCS) for the
entirety of these events," he said.

Radio amateurs are also ready and able to serve at evacuation centers,
providing support as needed.

Members of ARRL Headquarters staff have been in touch with ARRL
volunteers and other ham radio groups around the affected area, and are
offering material support for any activations. "It has been a busy start
to the year for ham volunteers," said ARRL Public Relations and Outreach
Manager Sierra Harrop, W5DX. "Whether it’s firestorms or ice storms
or any other need, ARRL volunteers selflessly serve their communities.
We’re mindful that large-scale events like this impact the hams who
are active serving," she said.

ARRL Director of Emergency Management Josh Johnston, KE5MHV, has been
on calls with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
other served agencies, offering ARRL resources. Efforts are being
coordinated locally by [Emergency Network Los Angeles \(ENLA\)][ENLA],
the Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) group in Southern
California.

Johnston urges hams in the affected regions to be ready to take care of
themselves and their families before needing to deploy. He points to
resources shared by ARRL’s
[Amateur Radio Emergency Service&reg; \(ARES&reg;\)][ARES]
during National Preparedness Month. "These are stressful events for
everyone, and being a ham volunteer is really second to keeping yourself
and your family safe," said Johnston.
