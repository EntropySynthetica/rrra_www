| Callsign  | KC0KAE  |
| --------- | ------- |
| Frequency | 146.715 |
| Offset    | -600    |
| Tone      | 123 Hz  |

>This is an analog repeater that is independent from W0ILO. This means
>we now have backup if W0ILO were to ever have an issue, or if W0ILO is
>busy during a net (for example, Fargo Marathon or Skywarn), there is
>another option for hams to use.
>
>It doesn't have quite the footprint that W0ILO has, but in our initial
>testing we have found that it covers Fargo quite well. All reception
>reports are welcome! [^1]
