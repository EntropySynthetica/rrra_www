This video is geared toward the new ham who wants a better understanding
of the NanoVNA. Maybe you are kind of familiar with the NanoVNA but some
stuff doesnâ€™t make sense to you yet. Maybe you would like to know what
else you can use a NanoVNA for other than use it as an antenna analyzer.
<!--more-->

I will cover the stuff that is not explained in other videos you find on
the NanoVNA and hopefully in a more understandable way.

In this video I will discuss the following:

* [00:00] Intro
* [02:10] What is a Vector Network Analyzer?
* [03:41] Should you buy a NanoVNA or an Antenna Analyzer?
* [05:56] What does an Antenna Analyzer do and what is SWR?
* [07:34] How does an Antenna Analyzer work?
* [08:45] How is a NanoVNA different and what are S11 and S21 measurements?
* [10:48] What are some kinds of S11 and S21 measurements you can make?
* [13:05] Why do you have to calibrate a NanoVNA?
* [16:14] What actually is calibration and when to do a partial or full calibration?
* [18:24] Test fixtures, adapters and accepting some level of error.
* [19:31] What do some of the more expensive models of the NanoVNA give you?
* [19:52] What is dynamic range?
