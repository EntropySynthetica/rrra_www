This is a demonstration of the minimal setup to download SSTV images from the International Space Station ISS. I use a Quansheng UV-K5 set to 145.800 an sql at 0. It is then decoded on the fly using an android tablet with the Robot36 app. You may also record the audio and later decode using Robot36, MMSSTV on your computer or your other favourite decoder.

Of course a fancy self tracking YAGI array would provide better quality, but the basics may also work just fine.
