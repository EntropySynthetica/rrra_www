### Salamander ID Reissue

The Salamander IDs previously issued to RRRAES members have expired or will
expire this year.

During this [meeting] we will start the process of issuing new IDs by 

1. Taking ID photographs.
2. Collecting application paperwork, including background investigation forms.

If would like to apply for a Salamander ID but are unable to attend
this meeting, please contact KC0ODE to schedule a meeting with the Cass
County Interim Emergency Manager to get your picture taken and submit
your paperwork.

Salamander IDs are not required for RRARES membership, but they do
make things easier during an incident---including public service
events---when checking in with local emergency management personnel or
with served agencies.

Please remember that possession of a Salamander ID is ***not*** a license to
self-deploy to an incident. Misuse of a Salamander ID may jeopardize the
ability of RRRA to support our community in the future.
