One of the really annoying things about ham radio is the sheer number
of different cables and connectors out there. With USB alone, there are
four or five common ones, and let’s not even talk about all the other
connectors for the variety of wall warts.

Reach into your power cord stash and you’ll see a variety of plugs:
four- and six-pin, barrel connectors, banana plugs, T-connectors, and
many more. It makes you wonder:

Do these manufacturers enjoy the misery they inflict by forcing all
these cables and connectors onto the world?

While not a true universal standard, Anderson Powerpoles® are widely
considered the go-to connector for 12Vdc power in the ham radio
community. They’ve become very popular for connecting radio equipment
to power sources like batteries and power supplies. Powerpoles are known
for their robust design and secure connections, reliability, ease of
use, and the ability to handle both high and low currents.

### History of Powerpoles

Anderson Powerpole connectors were developed by Anderson Power Products
(APP), a company that has designed and manufactured power connectors
for more than 60 years. They have built a reputation for creating
more effective electrical connections for a variety of applications,
including telecommunications, medical, automotive, and amateur radio.

Up until the year 2000, there was no single standard power connector for
12-volt DC that could handle the many needs of amateur radio operators
involved in emergency communications. It was recognized that during an
emergency, operators had to quickly hook up and interchange equipment
and power cables, but no single standard had been established.

The Powerpole’s genderless, non-polarized format enables you to make a
power extension cable taking a black-and-red power zip cord and cutting
it into two pieces in the field to make two power pigtails. You can fit
them with any connector you need, whether it is for the radio end or
the battery end. It doesn’t matter. It’s genderless, meaning you
don’t need to worry about male or female ends. Try that with any pair
of HF4/JST four-pin connectors.

[West Mountain Radio][rr] began offering break-out power strips called
RIGrunners, which were first available at Dayton Hamvention&reg; in 2001.
Other manufacturers have since offered solutions based on the Powerpole.

### Ease of Use

The connectors are simple to install. Same-size Powerpoles easily
plug into one another without using any adapters. Connectors come
in color-coded plastic housings for easy identification. Each color
corresponds to a recommended voltage. This color-coding system provides
users with a simple way to identify the appropriate connector for their
needs, reducing the chance of incorrect connections.

* Yellow (12V)
* Orange (18V)
* Red (24V)
* Gray (36V)
* Blue (48V)
* Green (72V)
* Black (80V)
* Brown (96V)
* Violet (120V)
* White (144V)

One of the most notable features of Anderson Powerpole connectors is
their modular design. The connectors consist of a plastic housing that
holds one or more metal contacts, typically copper or brass, passing
electrical current. The modular nature of the connectors means that
users can configure them in various ways depending on their specific
needs.

Another feature of Anderson Powerpoles is their reliability and ability
to maintain a strong electrical connection even in harsh environments.
The connectors are designed to withstand vibration, moisture, and
other challenging conditions. This is particularly important in
telecommunications and amateur radio applications, where systems are
often exposed to extreme temperatures and physical stress.

Powerpoles are also commonly used in automotive (such as recreational
vehicle) and marine applications. In these settings, the connectors
power devices such as inverters, winches, lighting systems, air
compressors, and battery chargers. The connectors can handle the high
currents often required for these systems, ensuring a reliable power
source for both temporary and permanent installations.

For battery systems used in solar power or backup generators, Powerpoles
link batteries together in series or parallel configurations. This
modular design allows users to build custom battery banks that meet
their specific voltage and current requirements.

### Making a Connection

Powerpoles have become the standard because a minimal number of tools
and parts are needed to assemble the connectors: wire, housings,
contacts, wire stripper, and crimp tool. You can solder them if you
want, but it’s much easier and neater to crimp the contact whether
assembling at your workbench or in the field.

Most [Powerpoles sold by ham retailers come in kits with multiple
housings and contacts][kit], usually red (+) and black (-) housings. They
slide together to make a single plug, which can be locked in place with
a rolled pin in the middle. A small drop of glue will keep the pin
in place. Locking retention pins with Powerpole strips can keep the
connections in place.

If you don’t need as many outlets as the RIGrunners provide, there
are smaller ones that act much like a cube tap to distribute multiple
12Vdc connections. They come as [simple splitters][ss] and [distribution
blocks][db]. You can also find [ready-made cables][rmc] for radios and
accessories with the Powerpoles already attached.

### A Plug for Using Powerpoles

With the rise of amateur radio emergency communications groups like
ARES® and RACES, Anderson Powerpoles have eventually become the de
facto standard for 12V power connections. Why? The connectors offer a
combination of durability, reliability, and ease of use, making them
an excellent choice for a variety of applications. It’s nice to have
a consistent type of 12Vdc plug available without searching for an
adapter.

Icom, Yaesu, and Kenwood still rely on the HF4/JST four-pin and
T-connectors for 12V power to their transceivers. But American companies
such as Flex and Elecraft are already using Powerpoles to connect
their base transceivers to DC power. [Power supplies made by Astron,
Alinco,][psu] and others now include Powerpoles, too.

Whether in amateur radio, automotive, industrial, or marine settings,
these connectors provide a secure and efficient solution for powering
devices and equipment. Their modular design and flexibility ensure users
can easily adapt them to meet their specific needs, making them a go-to
solution for hobbyists and professionals.
