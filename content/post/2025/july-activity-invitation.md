You are invited to bring your rig and/or antenna for others to see, and
to take a look at what others are using. This is a great opportunity to
learn about a rig's reception capabilities, ease of use, etc.

:star: There will be no formal presentation; you are welcome to stop by anytime
between 5 PM and 8:30 PM.

**In the event of inclement weather, the event will be held at our
normal meeting location, West Fargo Fire Department.** Change of venue
notifications will be sent to the [Announcement] and [RRRA] mailing
lists.

:electric_plug: We will have power options available for radios that
need it.

Also (especially for beginners) we'll have other important equipment to
demo such as antenna analyzers.
