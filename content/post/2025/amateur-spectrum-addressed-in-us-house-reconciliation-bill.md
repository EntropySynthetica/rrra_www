[ARRL The National Association for Amateur Radio&reg;][arrl] reports
that early this morning, May 22, 2025, the US House of Representatives
passed a massive Reconciliation bill with the below spectrum provisions
relevant to Amateur Radio.
<!--more-->

* Within two years not less than 600 megahertz must be identified from
between 1.3 and 10 GHz for reallocation to commercial use for broadband
services.
* The identified spectrum must be auctioned by the FCC for such services
on an exclusive, licensed basis as follows: not less than 200 megahertz
within three years (mid-2028) and the remaining spectrum (at least 400
megahertz) within six years (mid-2031).
* **Excluded** from spectrum that could be reallocated for these
purposes **is 3.1--3.45 GHz (which includes the temporary secondary
Amateur band at 3.300--3.450 GHz**) and 5.925--7.125 GHz.

With regard to Amateur spectrum, the bands that potentially could be
subject to consideration for reallocation under this legislation are 13
cm (2300--2310 & 2390--2450 MHz) and 5 cm (5650--5925 MHz).
At this time a number of bands have been mentioned informally for
consideration, none of which include Amateur spectrum. But the bands
under consideration could change and ARRL will closely monitor the
evolving situation.

Additionally, some government operations may be required to consolidate
in current Amateur secondary spectrum that is already shared with those
government uses. In select instances this might constrain Amateur
operations if such consolidation occurs.

It is to be emphasized that these provisions have been passed by the
House, but key US Senators have not agreed to some aspects and have
stated their intention to modify these provisions as the bill moves
through Senate consideration. The stated goal for final enactment is by
July 4, 2025.
