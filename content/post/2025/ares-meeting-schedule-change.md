:warning: Beginning with January 2025, RRRAES[^1] ARES meetings will
***only*** occur during months where a
[business meeting](/dates/club-meetings)
is scheduled, ***unless*** an announcement is made. 
<!--more-->

{{< banner >}}
As a special courtesy to our members for 2025, ARES meetings during
*activity months* will be displayed as <span class="red">canceled</span>
on the RRRA website calendar.
{{< /banner >}}

## Where will announcements be made?

:star: Our primary distribution method for announcements about ARES meetings are
the RRRA
[Club Announcements](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/announce) and
[Club Discussions](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra)
mailing lists. All RRRA members should be subscribed to one of these
lists.

:question: Announcements about ARES meetings ***may*** be
published as blog posts (which automatically propagate to
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/W0ILO) and
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.radio/@rrra.org@rss-parrot.net))

:x: It is ***highly unlikely*** that announcements about ARES meetings
will be made during a
[RRRA Sunday Night VHF/UHF net](/dates/ncs-schedule/).
RRRAES members should ***not*** rely solely on this distribution channel.
