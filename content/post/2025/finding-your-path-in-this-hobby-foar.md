As you might recall, recently I stumbled on an excellent list of 52
weekly challenges put together by Fabian, DJ5CW and friends. You can
find it at [hamchallenge.org](http://hamchallenge.org/). As I’ve
previously mentioned, it contains activities right across the amateur
spectrum, from designing a QSL card to making a contact on 80m or 160m,
with everything in between. It’s an excellent tool to set a weekly
goal to achieve and I recommend that you have a go.

It’s not the only interesting tool around.

Listen to this episode of the Foundations of Amateur Radio podcast:

Amal VU3FTH and Steph Piper, whom you might know as MakerQueen AU, have
put together an "Amateur Radio Skill Tree". It’s a collection of
hexagonal tiles, each with a skill, displayed together in an attempt
to track what you know and could know about amateur radio. The idea
is that you print it out and colour in each tile as you complete it.
You’ll find things like "Explore D-Star", "Build a cw key",
"Teach a friend about Amateur Radio", and plenty more. Can you get
four activities in a row and which skills could do with more effort?
There are 68 tiles ready for your colouring pencil ... Bingo!

The Radio Amateur Training Planning and Activities Committee, better
known as the RATPAC, put together an "Amateur Radio Challenges
Checklist for 2025" and published it on mastodon.radio. It’s a list
of bands, modes, activities, builds and clubs that help you track
what you’ve been up to throughout the year. While we’re here,
I should mention that the RATPAC in their words "comprises Amateur
Radio Operators of a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences",
and hosts two weekly Zoom meetings so anyone can participate in
the talks published on the [ratpac.us](http://ratpac.us/) website.
If you’re unable to attend, you’ll find the presentation on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RATPAC).

Over the years I’ve been part of this amazing hobby, I’ve been
telling anyone who will listen that there is plenty to do and see in
our community, a thousand hobbies in one. The tools I’ve mentioned
represent around one hundred and fifty activities and pursuits, but
hidden behind each one is plenty to explore. For example, hamchallenge
asks you to spend week 21 creating a GNU Radio flowgraph. That topic
alone could fill a decade worth of exploration if you were so inclined.
Similarly, one of the Skill Tree tiles is "Study RF propagation",
something which you might realise is easier said than done. The RATPAC
checklist has a tick box for "Work 100 countries", not something
you’re likely to achieve in an afternoon.

My point is, you can do as much or as little of this as you like, to
what ever degree floats your boat. As you might know, I’m deep in the
weeds with GNU Radio and I expect to stay there for plenty of time to
come, but you are under no obligation to follow me down the rabbit hole.
In other words, it interests me, but it might not do the same for you.

One final comment. None of these activities require you to upgrade your
license, well, other than the Skill Tree tile "Upgrade your radio
license". You can do most if not all of the activities I’ve shared
with any amateur license and plenty of it can be done without a license
at all.

So, what are you waiting for?
