*Social media users highlighted the importance of battery-operated radios
as the only reliable source of emergency information, while critics
pointed to the fragility of the current system.*

After [a large blackout][blackout] left much of Chile without
electricity last Tuesday, millions of people were affected and left
without communication. All courtesy of the fact that **the telecommunications
antenna service and the internet completely collapsed**.

In this scenario, and in the absence of real-time information,
social media users began to highlight **the importance of having
battery-powered
radios to access news in emergencies** such as the decision to declare a
[curfew][curfew].

Will we have to go back to copper wire telephones? Cell phones 'died'
in the emergency. Explanations do not serve in the face of a serious
episode. Earthquake, tsunami, flooding, or light cut like yesterday.
Totally incommunicado. **Only battery radio worked**, said the renowned
journalist, and radio voice **Sergio Campos**.

Many also recalled that this device has been key during earthquakes and
other disasters in the country, although there was no shortage of jokes.

"Serious question: does everyone really have a battery radio?," said a
user on the X platform. "It's always good to have one. My mother-in-law
has one and it's super old, but it works. And the radio too", joked
comedian Luis Slimming.

Although some users admitted to not having a functional radio at home,
implying that they had not previously considered it necessaru due to the
outdated technology, **other users reinforced the importance of having
one of these reliable devices that allow them to stay in touch**.

The work of the radio stations that continued to operate during the
emergency was also highlighted. And there was no shortage of criticism
of telephone phone companies and the widespread use of smartphones that
do not have an integrated FM Radio.

"I want to give a round of applause to the Chilean radio stations.
We would still be going around in circles if it weren't for the fact
that they continued to broadcast and report what was happening.
**Every Chilean home should have a battery-operated radio**," wrote
[@satoruswft](https://x.com/satoruswft).

It remains to be noted that Chile has historically faced natural
events that disrupt basic services, but the current dependence on
the Internet and cell phones has created a gap in preparation for
blackouts.

So, keep this in mind: a battery-operated radio is still a must-have in
an emergency.
