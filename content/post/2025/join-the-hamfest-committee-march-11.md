Join the RRRA Hamfest Committee and be a part of making your club's 2025
Hamfest a successful event.

The committee's first planning meeting is on
[Tuesday, March 11th]({{< relref "/calendar/2025/hamfest-committee-meeting-march.md" >}}).
<!--more-->

There is more to holding a successful hamfest than setting up the tables
on the day of the event. We have a lot to do beforehand.

For starters ...

* We need to start working on finding a place to hold our 2025 hamfest.
* We need to start working on the program of activities for our hamfest.
* We need to create a budget.
* We need to start working on event publicity; advertising and press
releases must be published many months in advance to ensure that
attendees see them far enough in advance to prioritize our hamfest over
others.
* If there will be seminars, we need to start working on finding dynamic
and interesting presenters. Do we want strictly passive presentations?
Or do we want engaging activities?
* If there will be a door prize drawing we need to start working on
soliciting prize donations.
* **And we need to find corporate sponsorship to underwrite the cost of
operating our hamfest so that ticket sales will be pure profit for our
club.**

All of these things take time and volunteers; more than the small
handful of hams who are currently committee members.

Please give serious thought to how you can help in the hamfest planning
and preparation process. Even if it is just for a limited amount of
time.

Our monthly planning meetings are held via the Zoom teleconferencing
system. Usually on the 2nd Tuesday of each month.
