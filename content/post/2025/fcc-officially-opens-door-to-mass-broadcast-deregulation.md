As [previewed][preview] by Commissioner Nathan Simington at the NAB
State Leadership Conference, the FCC is opening the floodgates to mass
deregulation of the broadcasting industry under the mantra of ***Delete,
Delete, Delete.***

{{< banner class="alert" >}}
<span style="font-size:larger;font-variant:small-caps;"><strong>
Amateur Radio Operators MUST pay attention to this deregulation effort.

Any general regulatory changes could negatively impact our hobby by favoring
commercial interests over Amateur Radio.

Hams are strongly encouraged to closely follow this proceeding and
submit their own substantive comments when warranted.

The FCC has [opened a public comment period][comment] as part of a broad effort
aimed at identifying and eliminating what it describes as unnecessary
or outdated regulations within the communications industry. The
initiative aligns with a series of executive orders issued by President
Trump, directing administrative agencies to reassess their regulatory
frameworks and promote economic growth by reducing burdens on
businesses.

The FCC's notice invites public feedback on specific rules that
may no longer serve their intended purpose or may be hindering
technological advancements, competition, or investment in communications
infrastructure. The Commission is particularly interested in hearing
from industry stakeholders about rules that disproportionately impact
small businesses, create barriers to market entry, or have become
obsolete due to changes in technology and the media marketplace.

"The Commission possesses a duty to evaluate its policies over time to
ascertain whether they work---that is, whether they actually produce
the benefits the Commission originally predicted they would," the FCC
stated in the notice.

The agency has outlined several key areas for review, including:

Cost-Benefit Analysis
: The FCC is examining whether certain regulations impose more costs
than benefits on businesses and whether eliminating or modifying these
rules could lead to better economic outcomes.

Market and Technological Changes
: With rapid advancements in digital communications, broadband, and
broadcasting, the FCC seeks to identify rules that have become outdated
or unnecessary.

Barriers to Entry
: The Commission is analyzing whether regulations place a
disproportionate burden on smaller firms, limiting competition and
innovation.

Legal and Constitutional Concerns
: The FCC is considering whether some regulations conflict with recent
judicial rulings, including the Supreme Court's Loper Bright decision,
which overturned the Chevron deference framework that had previously
granted agencies significant leeway in interpreting statutes.

Regulatory Redundancy
: The agency is also reviewing whether existing FCC rules overlap
with broader federal, state, or industry self-regulatory measures,
potentially creating unnecessary compliance burdens.

For broadcasters, this review could signal significant changes to
long-standing regulations that impact ownership rules, content policies,
and licensing requirements. The NAB has welcomed the news, as the
organization recently started a [mass public awareness campaign][mass]
tied to loosening ownership caps on radio and television broadcasters.

NAB SVP of Communications Alex Siciliano told Radio Ink, "We applaud
Chairman [Brendan] Carr for taking a deep dive into the many rules and
regulations that no longer serve any meaningful public interest purpose
and only hamper broadcasters' ability to compete. Chief among them are
the outdated ownership rules---both the national TV ownership cap and
the local radio and TV ownership rules---that must be reformed as soon
as possible. Without those changes, local journalism will struggle to
compete in this era of Big Tech and streaming dominance."

Interested parties have 30 days from the notice's release to submit
comments to the FCC, with a subsequent 15-day period for reply comments.

The FCC has emphasized that any proposed rule changes will be evaluated
based on their potential impact on the industry, consumers, and overall
market competition. The review process is expected to take several
months, with the Commission likely issuing further notices and proposed
rule changes based on the feedback received.
