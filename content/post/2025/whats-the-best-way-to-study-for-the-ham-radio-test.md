Whether you're interested in emergency communication, electronics, or
just want to talk to people worldwide, passing the ham radio test is the
first step. To get licensed, you need to demonstrate an understanding
of FCC regulations as well as knowledge of radio station operation and
safety considerations by taking a written test.

When was the last time you took a test and had access to all the
answers? The question pool for the ham radio exam is public knowledge;
you have access to all the possible questions and answers before taking
the test. [The National Conference of Volunteer Examination Coordinators
\(NCVEC\)][ncvec] provides a downloadable pool of questions and answers for the
Technician, General, and Extra tests. But there's a lot to remember.
Currently, the pools contain 411, 454, and 621 questions, respectively.

Remember that the test is not designed to keep people from getting
licensed. It's there to ensure you know how to use the technology
responsibly. There is no minimum age for licensing---applicants as young
as five years old have passed examinations.

### What Materials Do I Use?

That's a good question with many different answers. If you look at the
study manual options available from [DX Engineering][dxe] and others, you'll
find many choices. I think the [ARRL/Gordon West series][gordo] of exam prep
books is a good starting point. "Gordo" gives you just the information
you need to answer each question on the test, plus 125 links to some
helpful resources online. If you're taking a class sponsored by a local
club, they'll probably have a recommended list of resources used with
the course.

Consider your learning style. Find presentation methods that are most
effective for your learning style and then search out lessons in that
medium. Perhaps you find it easier to learn more from videos or reading
than sitting (or sleeping) through a class. Whenever you encounter
something you don't understand or want a visual or diagram, do an
Internet search. You can drill down for additional information if you
want.

Recent studies in education show that students benefit most from mixed
modality presentations---for example, using both lecture and visual
techniques. Our local club has adopted a multifaceted approach to
our classes by incorporating a popular online ham radio course which
includes video, text, quizzes, and games. Students work at their own
pace with a list of unit goals for the eight-week class. Each week,
instructors moderate a video Q & A session online to answer questions,
explain concepts, and track student progress.

### Memorization

Ham radio prep books introduce you to the questions you'll encounter
on your exam. Some may have brief explanations if you choose to read
them. I guess there are pros and cons to just memorizing answers.
Advantages of rote memorization include that it's helpful for test
preparation in the short term, and disadvantages include that you
won't necessarily remember the info you memorized long term.

One approach is focusing on the correct answers when studying for a ham
radio exam and ignoring the others. This approach can be beneficial when
the exam has a large question pool and numerous potential distractors.
By memorizing the correct answers and understanding the underlying
concepts, you can significantly reduce the information you need to
retain for the test. Craig Buck, K4IA, uses this approach in his study
guides.

Here's why focusing on correct answers can be beneficial. Amateur
radio exams have extensive question pools with each question having
four possible answers, only one of which is correct. Studying only the
correct answers reduces the information you need to memorize, making the
learning process more efficient. When you focus on the correct answers,
you are more likely to recognize them when you see them on the exam.

Creating word associations or acronyms for various study terms can help
them stick in your head. Making intentional, conscious associations puts
the learner in charge of their learning. Examples:

#### Dipole Formula

"2, 4, 6, 8, the last three do a dipole make!" 468/desired frequency in
MHz = 1/2 wave dipole length.

#### Ohm's Pie

Cover the part representing the answer you want, and the remainder of
the chart shows the formula you use.

### The Ham Cram

Pass the FCC Amateur Radio Technician Class Exam in less than six hours,
a day, or a weekend. Cram classes have been around for a long time. The
most well-known ones are for GED candidates preparing for the SAT, ACT,
and/or Advanced Placement exams for college admission. Ham radio license
candidates also cram for the exam.

Ham cram classes have one goal: to get your license in as little time
as possible. It's based on memorization. They condense information
into a short period, making instruction suitable for those with busy
schedules or limited time to study. While not comprehensive, the classes
can provide a foundation for learning more about ham radio later. Many
students report success using these methods, especially highly motivated
students who can work comfortably under pressure.

Some argue that cram classes rely too heavily on memorizing the question
pool and may not provide a thorough understanding of ham radio. When
the brain is overworked too much, it increases feelings of anxiety,
frustration, fatigue, and even confusion. Like the human body, the brain
needs time to breathe, relax, and refocus. Cramming does the opposite.

### Online Courses

Online ham radio courses became very popular in recent years, notably
around 2017 and 2018, as well as during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Organizations such as Ham Radio Prep, Hamstudy.org, and others pioneered
online study systems. Videos and online platforms made learning the
basics of amateur radio operation more accessible and easier to follow.
They're also accessible at your convenienceor when you can't
attend an in-person class.

Online ham licensing courses can be valuable for preparing for your ham
radio license exams. They often offer a structured learning approach,
interactive quizzes, and practice exams to help you master the material.
Many courses also explain incorrect answers, helping you learn from your
mistakes and understand the underlying concepts.

These courses provide a clear roadmap for learning, breaking down the
exam material into manageable sections and topics. Some courses offer
personalized feedback and track your progress, allowing you to focus on
areas where you need the most improvement. You can study at your own
pace and on your schedule, making it easier to fit your studies into a
busy life.

### Commitment

I've been involved in planning and teaching license classes for
several years. Nothing is more satisfying than seeing someone interested
in ham radio earn their first license. Those who accomplish that goal
are usually the ones who study and review daily.

The amount of time you will need to study for your ham radio license
exam will depend on your experience level, the class of license, and
the resources you're using. Some can pass the Technician exam with as
little as 10 hours of study. Others may need to study for 20--30 hours.
If you're currently a student, you're already in the study groove.

We know that "life happens," and sometimes you must temporarily
deviate from your study schedule. One way to keep on track is to give
yourself a deadline. If you're taking a class, you probably have a
built-in deadline for completing the class, followed by a group testing
session at the end of the course. Don't drag out the process if
you're doing self-study or an online course. If you go ahead and sign
up for a test date, you'll have motivation to get things done.

The worst thing you can do is spread out your studies over months (or
even years), because you'll waste too much time relearning stuff you
have forgotten. There seems to be a minimum threshold, typically around
10-20 minutes of study per day (depending on your memory), at which the
rate of forgetting things is equal to the rate of relearning thi ngs and
students stop making forward progress in the courses. An hour per day in
study mode keeps you comfortably away from the zero-progress zone.

### Checking Your Progress

It's generally recommended to continue study until you can
consistently score 80% or higher on practice exams. I'd recommend 85
to 90% to give you some extra insurance. [HamStudy.org], ARRL Exam Review
for Ham Radio&tm;, and [QRZ.com] provide free practice tests.

If you find yourself missing the same questions over and over, consider
making flashcards for them---only record the question and the right
answer. Review them periodically. You only need to review the ones you
miss. Presumably you know the rest.

Give yourself a break! Breaks allow the brain to rest, digest, and
organize new information, strengthening the connections needed for
long-term retention. Cartoonist Gary Larson summarizes the necessity
of breaks in one of his popular cartoons. Pictured is a classroom. A
student raises his hand and asks: "Mr. Osborne, may I be excused? My
brain is full."

### 74% --- You Can Do This!

Think about it. On ham radio exams, 74% is passing, leaving some room
for mistakes. For the Tech and General licenses, you only need 26
correct. If you're lousy at math, you can still pass. There's a
widespread belief that the exams are heavily math-oriented. Even on the
Extra exam, less than 10% of the exam questions require calculations.
Just learn the other stuff well, and you'll do fine.

If your primary goal is the license or upgrade, your best bet is
to focus on the materials actually on the exam. Later, you can
research ham radio topics more in-depth, using reference books like
The [ARRL Operating Manual][manual] or [The ARRL Handbook for Radio
Communications][handbook]. Very few hams ever touch the license manuals
once they've completed the exams. If you want some good ham reference
material, why not buy a book that will be helpful for years to come?
