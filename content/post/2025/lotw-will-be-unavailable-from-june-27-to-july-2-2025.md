ARRL's Logbook of The World&reg; (LoTW&reg;) is the 2nd most popular benefit
among members. It is also an extremely popular service internationally
for non-members, as it is the primary means for providing confirmations
for ARRL Awards, such as DXCC and Worked All States.

As a part of the ongoing modernization of the ARRL systems
infrastructure, LoTW will be receiving major upgrades to the operating
system it is running on, the relational database system it uses to
store and access logbook and awards data, and server hosting, where it
will be fully migrated to the cloud. These changes will, among other
improvements, ensure LoTW performance needs can be better met based on
user demand.

**LoTW will be unavailable from June 27 to July 2, 2025, to complete
these upgrades.** We will bring LoTW back online if it is available
sooner than July 2.

Logbook of The World can be found at [lotw.arrl.org]. More
information about the popular service is available at

Very 73, and see you on the air!

### About Logbook of The World&reg;

Logbook of The World&reg; --- LoTW&reg; --- is a web-accessed database and
repository that enables you to submit electronic logs for amateur radio
contacts (QSOs) and for confirmation (QSLs). Users can view submitted
QSOs and resulting QSLs online. Radio amateurs can use LoTW to track
their progress toward achievements and awards, such as The ARRL Worked
All States Award, and amateur radio's premier award, DXCC&reg;, in which
membership is achieved by confirming on-the-air contacts with 100
countries. LoTW was introduced by ARRL in 2003. Today, over 2.1 billion
QSO records have been entered into the system.
