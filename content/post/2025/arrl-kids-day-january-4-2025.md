Kids Day runs January 4, 2025 from 1800 UTC - 2359 UTC. Operate as much
or as little as you like.
<!--more-->

The event is designed to give on-the-air experience to young people, to
foster interest in getting a license of their own, and give older hams
a chance to share their stations and love for amateur radio with their
children. You can share the excitement with your own kids, grandkids, a
Scout troop, a church, or the general public!

All participants are encouraged to post their story and thumbnail photos
to the
[Kids Day Soapbox page](https://www.arrl.org/soapbox?utm_source=Informz&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=ARRL&_zs=pk0xl&_zl=5HAC3).
Tell the world about your operations, the fun you had, and the contacts
you made! Remember, ARRL must have a completed
[release form](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Model20/ModelReleaseForm.pdf)
in order to include youth photos (younger than 18 years of age) in ARRL
publications.

There will be a second ARRL Kids Day on June 21, 2025.

More information, including frequencies, suggested exchanges, and how
to download a certificate, can be found on the
[Kids Day web page](https://www.arrl.org/Kids-Day).
