When I got my amateur radio Technician license in March 2019, most of
my family were not licensed, the exceptions being my mom, who had held
her Technician class license since her middle school years, and my
grandfather, who had an Advanced license. However, neither of them was
very active, aside from the occasional listen in on an 80-meter net here
and there by my grandfather.

Despite their lack of activity, the fact that some in my family knew
what amateur radio was gave me an advantage in the radio community right
off the bat. They were willing to take me to local club meetings, Field
Day setups, and countless other events that some parents might have
taken one look at and turned away from. In fact, one of these outings,
and a particularly significant one at that, provided some of the biggest
reasons that I stayed involved with amateur radio.

The trip that my parents and I took to Dayton Hamvention&reg; a few
months after I got my license had a few different effects. I had the
opportunity to see other young YLs engaged and having fun with the
hobby, from those helping out at the AMSAT booth to those presenting
in the Carole Perry Youth Forum. But more importantly, I had the
opportunity to bond with my parents over a hobby that we all shared and
enjoyed. (In fact, I even upgraded to General with my mom at Dayton that
year!)

Having a child, grandchild, or other young person interested in amateur
radio can prove to be quite an interesting experience. I can confidently
say that my parents did not expect that my favorite things to do for
most of my high school years would be attending a ham radio summer camp
and spending hours in our ham shack working DX and improving my CW
skills.

However, it turned out to be the perfect opportunity to bond over a
hobby as a family and start learning new things together. Making it a
family hobby can be very helpful to a young person interested in amateur
radio.

The biggest challenge many of my fellow young hams have faced is a lack
of parental support, usually due to a lack of understanding, interest,
or receptiveness from their parents. If you have a child or grandchild
interested in pursuing amateur radio, getting licensed (while perhaps
helpful) isn’t entirely necessary. Doing a little bit of research and
learning about what, exactly, your child/grandchild is interested in is
immensely beneficial on its own.

On the other hand, you may already have your license and potentially
even be active in the hobby. Quite a few of the young hams I know got
into the hobby because of their already-licensed family members, so this
is relatively common. If that’s the case, it’s important to make
sure you don’t become too overbearing with this “family hobby.”
Let your child or grandchild figure out what parts of the hobby they
love (even if they differ from your favorite parts) and do your best to
help them pursue those aspects.

That could mean mentoring them if you have experience in their area of
interest, or it may be more effective to find someone else with more
experience in that aspect of the hobby, perhaps a member of a local
club who enjoys the activity in question or an on-the-air net revolving
around that specific topic.

Whether you are licensed or not, joining online groups that promote
various opportunities for young hams is also incredibly helpful. After
getting my license, my mom joined a few Facebook groups where she found
out about youth nets like the [YACHT \(Young Amateur Communications Ham
Team\)][yacht] net on Echolink and [YOTA \(Youth On The Air\)][yota]
activities and camps. With resources like this floating all around the
Internet, supporting a young person in amateur radio doesn’t have to
be extremely challenging, even if you have no idea what the hobby is at
first.

With a little bit of investment in learning about the hobby and becoming
part of the community, one way or another, you’ll have nearly
everything you need to effectively support the young person interested
in pursuing amateur radio.

You may even end up with a new hobby for the entire family to enjoy!
