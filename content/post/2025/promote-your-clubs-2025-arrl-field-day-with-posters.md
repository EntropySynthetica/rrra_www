[2025 ARRL Field Day][fd] will be here before you know it! We’re just
7 weeks away from ham radio’s biggest event, held each year on the
4th full weekend of June (28 – 29 for 2025). The [theme of "Radio
Connects"][theme] highlights the many ways amateur radio makes connections.
<!--more-->

As radio amateurs, we know the excitement of the weekend: it's part
get-together, part emergency communications exercise, part operating
event. It is also amateur radio’s time to shine and welcome the public
to learn about and experience this wonderful hobby.

A major aspect of any successful ARRL Field Day operation is the
publicity and outreach: How can the public learn about the event if they
don’t know it is happening? The ARRL Public Relations and Outreach
Committee recently held a publicity workshop for public information
volunteers. One of the tools presented is the 2025 ARRL Field Day
Poster. It can be posted around your area (think libraries, bulletin
boards, community centers, etc.) with your event information filled in
on it.

The 11x17" poster is available as a [free download][dl] [PDF] or [available
for purchase in packs of 25][25] from the ARRL Store. It tells the story
of amateur radio as fun hobby, resource for public service, and tool
for inspiring the next generation of technical leaders by providing
a hands-on sandbox where students gain experience in the fields of
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

ARRL Public Relations and Outreach Manager Sierra Harrop, W5DX, says
now is a great time to plaster the posters around your community.
"The summer tends to be a busy time with weddings, travel, and other
activities. Get your club’s ARRL Field Day activities in front of
people now with the posters so they can plan to be there."
