Many Technician class amateurs miss out on fun and skills learning of
traffic handling because they reside in areas of the country where
local traffic nets on VHF repeaters donâ€™t exist. The Virtual NTS
Training Net (VNTN) seeks to address this problem with the creation of
a Zoom-based local traffic net that can be accessed by anyone with an
internet connection.
<!--more-->

VNTN will accept check-ins and radiogram traffic utilizing standard
phonetics and pro-signs; in short, participants will enjoy the same
experiences as those who check into conventional "RF" traffic nets.
The net will incorporate a "hands-on" training approach in traffic
procedures, radiogram creation, and relay.

It is our hope that new amateurs who participate in VNTN will be
motivated to join section and region nets on HF after upgrading to a
higher license class.

The Net meets Wednesdays at 7:00 PM ET. In future, it is hoped that a
west coast version will be established at around 7 PM PT. The VNTN URL
is: https://bitl.to/3xj4.

Remember to monitor the [NTS website](https://nts2.arrl.org/) for
updates and Zoom URL changes.
