When the AMSAT-OSCAR 7 (AO-7) amateur radio satellite was launched in
1974, its expected lifespan was about five years. The plucky little
satellite made it to 1981 when a battery failure caused it to be written
off as dead. Then, in 2002 it came back to life. The prevailing theory
being that one of the cells in the satellites NiCd battery pack, in an
extremely rare event, failed open — thus allowing the satellite to run
(intermittently) off its solar panels.

[A recent video by \[Ben\]][video] on the *AE4JC Amateur Radio YouTube
channel* goes over the construction of [AO-7][ao-7], its operation, death
and subsequent revival are covered, as well as a recent [QSO][qso]
(direct contact). 

The solar panels covering this satellite provided a grand total of 14
watts at maximum illumination, which later dropped to 10 watts, making
for a pretty small power budget. The entire satellite was assembled in a
‘clean room’ consisting of a sectioned off part of a basement, with
components produced by enthusiasts associated with [AMSAT][amsat] around
the world. Onboard are two radio transponders: Mode A at 2 meters and
Mode B at 10 meters, as well as four beacons, three of which are active
due to an international treaty affecting the 13 cm beacon.

Positioned in a geocentric LEO (1,447 – 1,465 km) orbit, it’s quite
amazing that after 50 years it’s still mostly operational. Most of
this is due to how the satellite smartly uses the Earth’s magnetic
field for alignment with magnets as well as the impact of photons to
maintain its spin. This passive control combined with the relatively
high altitude should allow AO-7 to function pretty much indefinitely
while the PV panels keep producing enough power. All because a NiCd
battery failed in a very unusual way
