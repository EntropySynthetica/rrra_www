2025 ARRL Field Day is just three weeks away! The excitement is
building. Most clubs have their activations planned. In the last
two weeks, 350 more sites have been added to the [Field Day Site
Locator][loc], with a total of 886 listed as of June 5. ARRL Field Day
is a great way to connect with your local amateur radio community, for
Technician-class operators to get on lower HF bands, to shake down your
portable operating gear, and to have fun and enjoy the camaraderie of
your fellow hams.

If you can't make it out to an activation near you, or you'd just rather
get on for a little bit from your home station --- never fear: there's
an operating class for you.

According to [Field Day rules][rules]:

Class D stations 

: are *home stations operating from permanent or licensed station
locations using commercial power. Class D stations can count contacts
with any other station for QSO credit.* If you're operating on a radio
plugged into a power supply connected to your wall outlet --- this is
for you.

Class E stations

: are *home stations using emergency power for
transmitters and receivers. Class E may work all Field Day stations.*
If you're operating off a battery, solar, wind, or any other off-grid
redundancy --- you're in Class E.

To determine your exchange for ARRL Field Day, use the number of
transmitters in simultaneous use, the class of operation, and your ARRL
or Radio Amateurs of Canada section prefix. For example, if an amateur
in Nebraska turned on their shore-powered home station and operated in
the event, they'd be "1 Delta November Echo". See the full rules for
more information and find a list of ARRL Sections at [this link].

ARRL Field Day is fun, but the outreach value is serious, according to
ARRL Public Relations and Outreach Manager Sierra Harrop, W5DX. "Each
year, ARRL Field Day is the driving force for official proclamations
declaring amateur radio a vital part of communities," she said. States
like Hawaii and New Hampshire, among others, have joined with towns and
counties around the country to declare the importance of amateur radio.

"Having the governor or even a town council recognize the value that
the hams in their community provides is invaluable," continued Harrop.
"Not only does it honor the work of amateur radio volunteers, but it
raises awareness of ham radio among the public."
