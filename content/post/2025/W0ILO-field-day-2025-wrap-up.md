[ARRL Field Day][fd] 2025 is now in the history books. The Red River Radio Amateurs
once again activated their club callsign---W0ILO---as a Class 3A[^1] station from the
[Cass County Highway Department][site] in West Fargo, ND.  

We had 22 visitors and operators on our sign-in sheet at the end of the
event, including some who were visiting us for the first time to see
what ham radio was all about.

### Publicity

We would like to extend big thank-you to Chuck KE0MW for doing a
great job with our media outreach during the event.

And we had some pre-event media and on-line exposure (thanks to Steve K0STK)
including:

* [Inforum Article][article]
* [KVRR News Segment][segment]

:star: RRRA Members have access to the club's complete [Field Day 2025 Publicity archive][archive]

We had several folks come out to visit after seeing the [article] in
the Forum. We also had a few new hams who had gotten their licenses but
hadn't made their first QSOs yet. It was wonderful to see them get their
first contacts.

### Operating 

The bands seemed to be in pretty good shape, and I saw the SSB stations
routinely making contacts. I stuck to the digital and CW station, which
also did fairly well, although I had to fight with some time sync issues
on the FT8 computer. I will be cooking up a GPS-enabled Raspberry Pi for
a time sync server next year.

Late in the afternoon, we were visited by our Dakota Division assistant
section managers: Nancy K0YL and Rich W0TF. Thank-you so much for
making the trip. Nancy and Rich shared some photos of funnel clouds they
saw earlier in the day.

And speaking of weather, that was our other visitor for the early
evening. While it did not impact us directly, the winds from the outflow
boundary prompted us to lower the two antennas we had up: a 40-meter
dipole and a 4-element multi-band beam. The dipole was held up by a boom
lift that Chuck provided for us. We had that antenna down in seconds.
The beam took a bit more work but was lowered within a few minutes.
While the antennas were down, I dropped the power to 5 watts and worked
some stations on CW. A second storm, which did hit us, followed the
first about an hour later. Anton KC0PFS and I rode out the storm in the
trailer; fortunately it was just heavy rain.

With the storm passed, we got the 40-meter dipole back up as quickly as
it was lowered, as well as the beam, and were back on the air. Around 9
PM, we listened to a pass of RS-44, a linear transponder ham satellite
that you can use for FT4, CW, and SSB. I didn't have a second radio for
an uplink, so we just listened to the pass, but it was interesting to
hear all the conversations on it.

Our night crew, Tim K0CRF, started getting going around 11 PM on
20-meter SSB. The band seemed to stay viable well past midnight. I took
a nap in the passenger seat of my car and woke up around 3 AM because of
a passing rain shower. After the rain, I got on 40-meter CW around 3:30
AM, and it was amazing. The noise on the band was gone, stations were
spaced out very nicely, and speeds were on the slower side.

Folks started to show back up around 7 AM, and we operated until about noon.

Thank-you to everyone who helped with setup and teardown, and everyone
who worked some radio. I'm afraid to start listing folks and forget to
mention someone.

### Results

At the end of field day our log showed:

| Mode | Number of contacts  |
| ------- | ----  |
| Phone   | 205  |
| CW      | 29   |
| Digital | 47   |

And we copied the ARRL Field Day Bulletin.

We had eight different operators (it's possible there were more,
but someone might have operated and forgotten to put their initials and
call into the logger).

Thanks, all, for the fun at Field Day 2025. I'm already planning and
looking forward to 2026.
