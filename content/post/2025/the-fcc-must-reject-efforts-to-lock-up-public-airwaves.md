President Trump's attack on public broadcasting has attracted
plenty of deserved attention, but there's a far more technical,
far more insidious policy change in the offing---one that will take
away Americans' right to unencumbered access to our publicly owned
airwaves.
<!--more-->

The FCC is quietly [contemplating] a fundamental restructuring of all
broadcasting in the United States, via a new DRM-based standard for
digital television equipment, enforced by a private "security
authority" with control over licensing, encryption, and compliance.
This move is confusingly called the "ATSC Transition" (ATSC is the
digital TV standard the US switched to in 2009 â€“ the "transition"
here is to ATSC 3.0, a new version with built-in DRM).

The "ATSC Transition" is championed by the National Association of
Broadcasters, who want to effectively privatize the public airwaves,
allowing broadcasters to encrypt over-the-air programming, meaning that
you will only be able to receive those encrypted shows if you buy a new
TV with built-in DRM keys. It's a tax on American TV viewers, forcing
you to buy a new TV so you can continue to access a public resource you
already own.

This may not strike you as a big deal. Lots of us have given up on
broadcast and get all our TV over the internet. But millions of American
still rely heavily or exclusively on broadcast television for everything
from news to education to simple entertainment. Many of these viewers
live in rural or tribal areas, and/or are low-income households who
can least afford to "upgrade." Historically, these viewers have
been able to rely on access to broadcast because, by law, broadcasters
get extremely valuable spectrum licenses in exchange for making their
programming available for free to anyone within range of their broadcast
antennas.

Adding DRM to over-the-air broadcasts upends this system. The "ATSC
Transition" is a really a transition from the century-old system of
universally accessible programming to a privately controlled web of
proprietary technological restrictions. It's a transition from a
system where anyone can come up with innovative new TV hardware to one
where a centralized, unaccountable private authority gets a veto right
over new devices.

DRM licensing schemes like this are innovation killers. Prime example:
DVDs and DVD players, which have been subject to a similar central
authority, and haven't gotten a single new feature since the DVD
player was introduced in 1995.

DRM is also incompatible with fundamental limits on copyright, like
fair use. Those limits let you do things like record a daytime baseball
game and then watch it after dinner, skipping the ads. Broadcasters
would like to prevent that and DRM helps them do it. Keep in mind that
bypassing or breaking a DRM system's digital keys---even for lawful
purposes like time-shifting, ad-skipping, security research, and so
on---risks penalties under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. That is, unless you have the time and resources to beg
the Copyright Office for an exemption (and, if the exemption is granted,
to renew your plea every three years).

Broadcasters say they need this change to offer viewers new interactive
features that will serve the public interest. But if broadcasters have
cool new features the public will enjoy, they don't need to force us
to adopt them. The most reliable indicator that a new feature is cool
and desirable is that people voluntarily install it. If the only way to
get someone to use a new feature is to lock up the keys so they can't
turn it off, that's a clear sign that the feature is not in the public
interest.

That's why EFF joined Public Knowledge, Consumer Reports and others
in [urging the FCC][urging] to reject this terrible, horrible, no good, very
bad idea and keep our airwaves free for all of us. We hope the agency
listens, and puts the interests of millions of Americans above the
private interests of a few powerful media cartels.
