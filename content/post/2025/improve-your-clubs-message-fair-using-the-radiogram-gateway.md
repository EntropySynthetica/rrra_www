The following story appeared in the March 18, 2025 issue of ARRL Club News:

Your club is planning to staff a table at a local community fair or
event. Offer to send radiograms. Recruit volunteers to explain what a
radiogram is and, later, send the messages. Who in your radio club is
active on the traffic nets? How many members know the radiogram format
or know how to send a radiogram message on the air? Fear not! Your club
can put its best foot forward and hold an amateur radio message fair
with minimal traffic-handling skills using an exciting new tool: the
[Radiogram Portal]!

Jonathan Taylor, K1RFD, inventor of EchoLink, has developed a web-based
tool that the public can use to enter a short message by following
simple instructions. The message will be picked up by a participating
amateur radio volunteer operator (called a "radiogrammer") who logs
in to a restricted portion of the website, takes the message off the
gateway, and sends it over the air on a National Traffic System (NTS)
net for relay to its destination. The recipient will get a local phone
call from a nearby ham. Along the way, ham operators will relay the
messages by voice, digital, or even Morse code and get valuable practice
in emergency public service.

"Itâ€™s not a problem if your club lacks an active traffic handler
to check into the traffic nets," says Phil Temples, K9HI, who chairs
the ARRL EC-FSC NTS subcommittee. "You merely set up a laptop at your
message fair using a Wi-Fi connection and allow members of the public to
enter their own messages. Later, a skilled traffic handler in your area
will pull the message off the portal and send it in a timely fashion."

The Radiogram Portal was successfully demonstrated at the 2024 New
England Division Convention. An extensive display sponsored by the
Nashua (New Hampshire) Area Radio Society highlighted the NTS and the
Radiogram Portal running on a computer, along with a trifold that
pictured the NTS2 website, the NTS Letter, training videos, and a
downloadable handout available for clubs and public gatherings.
