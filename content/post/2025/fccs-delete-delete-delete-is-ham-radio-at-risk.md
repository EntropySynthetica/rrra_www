Is the FCC’s new ***Delete, Delete, Delete*** agenda sounding the
death knell for amateur radio? In this video Jim N4BFR breaks down
the FCC’s latest public notice and what it really means for hams.

From the very real threat of spectrum auctions to possible changes in
antenna regulations (PRB-1) and license fees, we’re connecting the
dots on how this might affect your privileges on the air.

While amateur radio isn’t disappearing overnight, there’s plenty
you should know about---plus ways to make your voice heard. Share your
feedback with the FCC (preceding number 25-133) and reach out to your
congressional representatives. 

Stay informed, stay active, and stay on the air!
