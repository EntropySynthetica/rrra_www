The ARRL Foundation is accepting grant applications from amateur
radio organizations for eligible amateur radio-related projects and
initiatives, particularly those focused on educating, licensing, and
supporting amateur radio activities. To grow amateur radio's future,
youth-based projects and initiatives are especially encouraged.

The ARRL Foundation grants program accepts proposals on a cyclical
model three times a year: in February, June, and October. Proposals for
the June grant period are accepted through June 30. Awardees will be
notified approximately 1 month after the closing of each cycle.

The ARRL Foundation carefully manages a portfolio of endowments
where donors have provided specific goals for their gifts, and
that portfolio is invested and managed in a way that it can
continue to support those goals for many years to come. Additional
information and a link to the grant application can be found at
