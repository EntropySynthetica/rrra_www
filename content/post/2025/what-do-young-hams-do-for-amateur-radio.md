I’m sure the vast majority of hams have heard the quip, "Youth are
ruining ham radio," or something similar.

I can assure you that I have.

I can’t even begin to count the number of times that young hams using
digital modes has been equated with the downfall of the entire hobby as
we know it. Regardless of this common stereotype, I think it’s time
for us to take a deeper look into what youth are actually contributing
to the hobby.

Young amateurs bring an impressive amount of enthusiasm and vivacity to
the amateur radio community. They possess an immense amount of technical
skill and flexibility, in addition to their nearly universal desire to
create a welcoming and supportive environment for both their younger and
older peers through volunteerism and encouragement.

From my experiences working with young hams and by looking at some of my
favorite things to do in ham radio, I’ve noticed that younger members
of the amateur radio community enjoy a number of things that older
enthusiasts perhaps wouldn’t expect, including contesting, hamfests,
rag-chewing, and even CW. Young hams bring with them into these realms
technical adeptness that enhances the already existing methods of doing
things and, in some cases, even develop new ones. They also provide
diverse points of view and an openness to trying new things and meeting
new people, all things that greatly benefit the hobby.

The young amateur radio operators who I’ve met through various
organizations like [YACHT \(Young Amateur Communications Ham
Team\)][yacht] and [YOTA \(Youth On The Air\)][yota] offer new and
unique ways of thinking as well as problem-solving abilities. The
objectives of YACHT and YOTA are to get young hams together so that they
can mentor each other and learn from people relatively close to their
age.

Through the years, this model has proven extremely successful. For
example, during the pandemic I was interested in learning about computer
coding. One of my fellow YACHT members was interested in learning
Morse code. Regardless of the geographical difference of nearly half
the country, we quickly became friends and mentored each other in our
respective areas of interest. To this day, we are still very close
friends and share what we are learning through amateur radio.

Similar connections are common in the YOTA group as well. The young
people who attend YOTA events leave with boundless new knowledge,
connections, and, most importantly, new friends. By giving young hams
the opportunity to learn from each other, the sharing of ideas is
encouraged, leading to some pretty unique solutions to problems.

As I’m sure you’ve inferred by this point, young hams also have an
overwhelming desire to make the amateur radio community a welcoming and
supportive place for everyone they meet. The spirit of volunteerism
is very much alive and well within the youth sector of amateur radio
licensees. I’ve noticed that there is almost always a young ham with
his or her older peers while they’re assisting with communication or
coordination at community events like 5k races. From local clubs to
larger groups like the [Long Island CW Club][licw], YACHT, and YOTA,
there are always opportunities for young hams to serve the amateur radio
community however they can or would like to.

There is an immense pressure on young people to volunteer, whether
that be from their schools (some even requiring hours for graduation),
the National Honor Society or similar organizations, or elsewhere.
Amateur radio provides an opportunity to volunteer in a capacity that is
meaningful to them and where they’ll get to see the positive effects
of their work, resulting in a love of volunteerism and a desire to
continue their work in these capacities long after it is "required"
for school or other organizations.

All in all, after having reflected on the stigma that youth are
"ruining" ham radio, I think we can agree that the opposite is
true. The assertion that youth are a burden to the hobby and its
history is far from the truth—if anything, they are helping expand
the pre-existing culture of volunteerism while bringing a new sense
of excitement and enthusiasm to the hobby. Hopefully, young hams will
continue to pursue new ventures in amateur radio, be a source of
enthusiasm, and elevate the hobby by encouraging their friends and
family to become active and join the community of amazing people that
amateur radio is.
