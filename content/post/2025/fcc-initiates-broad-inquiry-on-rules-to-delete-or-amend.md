In a Public Notice titled "In Re: Delete, Delete, Delete," issued on
March 12, 2025, the FCC is soliciting public input on any FCC rules
in any service that members of the public believe should be deleted
or modified "for the purpose of alleviating unnecessary regulatory
burdens." This is the latest in a series of similar proceedings going
back to 1996, when the Communications Act was amended to require the FCC
to periodically review its rules.

ARRL The National Association for Amateur Radio&reg;, through its
Executive Committee and FCC Counsel, is conducting a review of the
provisions in Part 97 and other related rules that apply to radio
amateurs. ARRL is also soliciting feedback from its members. Rules
identified as outmoded, obsolete, or that for other reasons should
be repealed or modified, will be included in ARRLâ€™s filing to be
submitted no later than the FCC deadline of April 11, 2025. The deadline
for filing reply comments is April 28, 2025.

It is expected that the Commission will incorporate suggestions that
it decides worthy of its consideration in a future Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPRM) that could be issued later this year. There will then
be an opportunity for public comment on the specific rules that the
Commission proposes for deletion or modification.
