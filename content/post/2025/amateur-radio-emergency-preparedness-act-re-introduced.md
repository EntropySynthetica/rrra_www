**WASHINGTON** – U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Richard
Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Representatives August Pfluger, R-Tex.,
and Joe Courtney, D-Conn. announced their joint re-introduction of
legislation in the Senate and House to restore the right to Amateur
Radio operators to install the antennas necessary to serve their
communities.

Homeowner association rules often prevent Amateur Radio operators from
installing antennas at their homes even though Amateur Radio has proven
to be essential in emergencies and natural disasters such as hurricanes
when other means of communication fail.

"Mississippians should have access to every possible means of
warning for natural disasters, including amateur radio operators. In
an emergency, those warnings can mean the difference between life
and death," **Senator Wicker** said. "The Amateur Radio Emergency
Preparedness Act would remove unnecessary roadblocks that could help
keep communities safe during emergencies like tornadoes, hurricanes, and
fires."

"When disaster strikes, amateur radio operators provide vital, often
life-saving information, which shouldn’t be hindered by prohibitive
rules or confusing approval processes. The Amateur Radio Emergency
Preparedness Act eliminates obstacles for ham radio enthusiasts,
allowing them to continue their communications and serve their
communities in the face of emergencies," said **Senator Blumenthal**.

"Natural disasters and other emergency situations that hinder our
regular lines of communication are unfortunately unavoidable, which is
why we must bolster our emergency preparedness by removing the barriers
amateur radio operators often run into when installing antennas. Amateur
radio plays a vital role in public safety by delivering critical
information to people at all times. My district is home to dozens of
amateur radio operators ready to volunteer in the event of an emergency,
and I am proud to lead this legislation," said **Congressman August
Pfluger**.

"As we know from recent natural disasters, amateur radio operators
in Connecticut can be a critical component of disaster response and
emergency management. It is in our communities’ best interest that we
give them the capabilities to operate at the highest level, and with
the re-introduction of this bill, we’ve taken a strong step in that
direction," said **Congressman Courtney**.

## Background

The Amateur Radio Emergency Preparedness Act of 2025 (H.R. 1094 and S.
459) would require homeowner associations to accommodate the needs of
FCC-licensed Amateur Radio operators by prohibiting the enforcement of
private land use restrictions that ban, prevent, or require the approval
of the installation or use of Amateur Radio station antennas. Homeowner
associations have often prevented installation and use of such antennas
through private land use restrictions. This has hindered voluntary
training for emergency situations and blocked access to necessary
communications when disaster strikes.

Among other provisions, this legislation would:

* Prohibit homeowner association rules that would prevent or ban Amateur
Radio antennas;
* Specify an approval process for installing Amateur Radio antennas;
* Provide a Federal private right of action to Amateur Radio operators
in disputed cases.

On behalf of America’s Amateur Radio licensees, Rick Roderick, the
President of The American Radio Relay League, re-confirmed the ARRL’s
full support for the passage of the Amateur Radio Emergency Preparedness
Act of 2025 and extended his thanks and appreciation to Senators Wicker
and Blumenthal and Congressmen Pfluger and Courtney for their unflagging
leadership of the bi-partisan effort to support and protect the rights
of all Amateur Radio Operators.
