Momentum is building for ARRL's Ham Radio Open House---an amateur
radio event for clubs to put their most technological foot forward and
show the public the true modern state of amateur radio. The events are
to be held in April across the United States, on or close to World
Amateur Radio Day (WARD) on April 18. This year's WARD commemorates
100 years of the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU).

The goal for participation is 50 clubs in 50 states â€“ but the more the
merrier. ARRL is working with Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation
(HamSCI and SciStarter to promote the event as part of April being
Citizen Science Month.

"We've had a lot of clubs express interest and commitment to be a
part of Ham Radio Open House," said ARRL Public Relations and Outreach
Manager Sierra Harrop, W5DX. "Thanks to some great volunteer outreach
efforts, clubs are seeing the value of showing off the true current
state of amateur radio," she said.

Many other clubs in overlapping hobbies are being engaged. Several
astronomy clubs have agreed to partner with local ham clubs to co-host
the event.

A public information training workshop will be held for ARRL Public
Information Coordinators, Public Information Officers, Section Managers,
club leaders, and others with an interest in hosting and promoting an
ARRL Ham Radio Open House. The live, interactive, webinar is scheduled
to be held on Wednesday, March 19, 2025, at 8:30 PM Eastern / 5:30 PM
Pacific. Look for a registration link next week.
