Eric Tichansky, NO3M, of Saegertown, Pennsylvania, has been issued the
first [Worked All States][was] award from [ARRL The National Association for
Amateur Radio&reg;][arrl] for the 630-meter band. He picked up the award at ARRL
Headquarters in Newington, Connecticut, on April 21, 2025. That was the
culmination of years of study, work, and experimentation.

Tichansky had a draw to 160 meters early in his ham radio career and was
active in contesting and DXing on top band. When he moved to his current
home, he was able to experiments with LowFER operation. [When 630 meters
opened to amateur use][opened], he got straight to work. "It seemed like an
unreachable goal at the time, but patience and persistence as well as
gaining more and more of an understanding of the capabilities of the
band over the years proved otherwise," said Tichansky.

His transmit antenna system has been a journey in trial, error, and
fire---he's a member of what he calls the "Hall of Flames."
He says he "definitely learned that good quality insulators do make
a difference." After years of work and refinement of matching and
loading techniques, his 67-foot vertical with 8 sloping toploading wires
as a wire skirt over a large radial field have proven to be the ticket
to success. "For reception, I have always used dedicated receive
antennas which have included phased Beverages, a full-sized 8-circle
vertical array, and various others like a terminated loop," said
Tichansky.

As news of the award achievement spread in the amateur community, even
many long-time hams with little or no experience on 630 meters wondered
how it worked. Tichansky says Alaska and Hawaii proved especially
challenging. "(The states) were certainly a challenge, Alaska perhaps
moreso. However, both locations had excellent resident operators and
stations and through persistent attempts and the right conditions,
two-way QSOs were completed. I have a few CW QSOs with K9FD/KH6 (SK)
which still stand as the distance record on 630 for CW. I also have the
overall distance record for a QSO with VK4YB via JT9 which took a long
time and many attempts, finally finding success on a morning (US side)
near the equinox," he said.

Tichansky says there are several other operators right behind him,
with WAS almost completed. In fact, ARRL Awards Branch Manager Sharon
Taratula announced today that Edward Gray, WÃ˜SD, of Salem, South
Dakota, has been awarded 630-meter WAS #2.

Most of the contacts on the band happen just like any other band, says
Tichansky, from getting on and calling CQ or replying to one. Very few
of his contacts on there were scheduled.

It takes an experimenter's mind and a lot of patience to be successful
on the band, but like with any other operating specialty, there is a
community ready to help. "The 630-meter community is very diverse,
but there are a number of members that come from particular backgrounds
including microwave operations, EME, topbanders and other weak signal
communications. The thing we have in common is that we are experimenters
and enjoy a bit of a challenge!" exclaimed Tichansky.

He currently has a DXCC total of 17 on the band. Tichansky plans to
contribute technical articles about operating on 630-meters to QEX
magazine in the coming months. All ARRL members have access to QEX and
[three other high-quality publications digitally][mags].
