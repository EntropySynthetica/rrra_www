In its discussions with the FCC, ARRL has stated:

>"In several places, the Enforcement Advisory makes the point that
>'anyone importing, advertising or selling such noncompliant devices
>should stop immediately, and anyone owning such devices should not use
>them,'" ARRL pointed out. "The Advisory broadly
>prohibits the 'use' of such radios, but our view is that there
>is no such prohibition relative to licensed Amateur Radio use---entirely
>within amateur allocations---of a radio that may be capable
>of operation in non-amateur spectrum, as long as it is not actually used to
>transmit in non-amateur spectrum. [^1]

The Enforcement Advisory includes the following *Amateur Radio Exception*
which appears to disallow the use of certain uncertified devices in the
Amateur Radio Service:

>If a device is capable of operating only on frequencies that the FCC has
>allocated for use by Amateur Radio Service licensees, it does not require FCC
>equipment authorization, and an amateur licensee may use his or her license
>to operate such radios. However, many two-way radios that purport to operate
>on amateur frequencies also operate on frequencies that extend beyond the
>designated amateur frequency bands. If a two-way VHF/UHF radio is capable of
>operating outside of the amateur frequency bands, it cannot be imported,
>advertised, sold, or operated within the United States without an FCC
>equipment certification. [^2]
