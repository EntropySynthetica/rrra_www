There is now another digital repeater available in the Fargo-Moorhead
metro area: the
[KD0IOE DMR/YSF repeater at 444.625+ CC1](https://kd0ioe.com/repeater/). This
repeater is an
[MMDVM]({{< relref "/post/2018/kd0ioe-dmr-and-ysf-repeater-available-for-public-use.md#about-mmdvm">}})
based system that currently has
[DMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio) and
[YSF](https://systemfusion.yaesu.com/what-is-system-fusion/)
enabled, with both timeslots available. It is located at my West Fargo
home, linked to the Internet and available for public use.

A technical description of the repeater, along with
[DMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio) timeslot and
[Brandmeister](http://brandmeister.network)
information is available on the
[KD0IOE Repeater page](https://kd0ioe.com/repeater/).

Please contact me at {{< mailto KD0IOE >}} if you have any specific questions
about my setup.
