The [NIST FY 2019 Presidential Budget Request](https://www.nist.gov/fy-2019-presidential-budget-request-summary) includes funding for the ***"shutdown of NIST radio stations in Colorado and Hawaii."*** [^1]

NIST plans to shut down these valuable resources even though
[their WWV page](https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/radio-stations/wwv) boasts of the station having **millions of listeners worldwide**.

Everyone who uses [WWV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_\(radio_station\))/[WWVH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWVH), or just recognizes the value of these resources to our nation, is encouraged to sign the [White House petition to maintain funding for NIST stations WWV & WWVH](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/maintain-funding-nist-stations-wwv-wwvh) and to [contact their elected representatives in Congress](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials/).

The proposed WWV/WWVH shutdown has been reported on-line 
by [the ARRL](http://www.arrl.org/news/nist-fy-2019-budget-would-eliminate-wwv-and-wwvhC), [The SWLing Post](https://swling.com/blog/2018/08/nist-fy2019-budget-includes-request-to-shutdown-wwv-and-wwvh/) but not, aparently, yet by mainstream media sources. The shutdown is being discussed in numerous places including:

### About WWV and WWVH

WWV and WWVH are more than just sources of time signals. These stations also
provide frequency standards used by Amateur Radio Operators,
[SWLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortwave_listening) and others;
they are a good indicator of HF propagation conditions; and 
they are a source of valuable [recorded announcements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWV_(radio_station)#Other_voice_announcements)
of general interest on an hourly schedule---including
the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather
warnings---on HF bands from 2.5--20 Mhz.

>NIST radio station WWV broadcasts time and frequency information 24
>hours per day, 7 days per week to ***millions of listeners*** worldwide. WWV
>is located near Fort Collins, Colorado, about 100 kilometers north of
>Denver. The broadcast information includes time announcements, standard
>time intervals, standard frequencies, UT1 time corrections, a BCD time
>code, geophysical alerts and marine storm warnings. [^2]
