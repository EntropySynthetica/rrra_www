Officers and a Board of Directors are essential to the operation of
the Red River Radio Amateurs and our club owes a debt of gratitude to
those who have stepped forward to fill these leadership positions.

But, for the health of our organization, we can not continue to depend
upon the same few individuals in perpetuity. It is, therefore, well past
time for new Officers to step forward from within our membership.

As specified in 
[Article III] ({{< relref "/bylaws.md#article-iii-fiscal-year" >}}) of the
[RRRA Bylaws]({{< relref "/bylaws.md" >}}),
a leadership election will be conducted during the
[February Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2018/february-meeting.md" >}}).
