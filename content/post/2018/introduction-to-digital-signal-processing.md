Digital Signal Processing is central to the
[software-defined radios \(SDR\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio)
and [digital modes](http://www.hfradio.org.uk/html/digital_modes.html)
which are an increasingly important part of Amateur Radio.

Radio operators interested in beginning to learn about the mathematical
underpinnings of the digital side of their hobby are encouraged to take
advantage of the
[Introduction to Digital Signal Processing](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/)
maintained by Tom O'Haver, Professor Emeritus, Department of Chemistry
and Biochemistry University of Maryland at College Park, as a retirement
project and an
[international community service](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/Countries.html).

In his Introduction, Professor O'Haver writes:

>[This essay](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/)
>covers only basic topics related to one-dimensional time-series
>signals, not two-dimensional data such as images. It uses a pragmatic
>approach and is limited to mathematics only up to the most elementary aspects
>of calculus, statistics, and matrix math. For the math phobic, know that this
>essay does not dwell on the math and that it contains more than twice as many
>figures as equations. Data processing without math? Not really! Math is
>essential, just as it is for the technology of cell phones, GPS, digital
>photography, the Web, and computer games. But you can get started using these
>tools without understanding all the underlying math and software details.
>Seeing it work makes it more likely that you'll want to understand how it
>works. But in the long run, it's not enough just to know how to operate the
>software, any more than knowing how to use a word processor or a MIDI
>sequencer makes you a good author or musician. [^1]
