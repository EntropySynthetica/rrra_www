### About The Ride

*The Flatlander! FM Rotary Ride* is the sixth annual cycling celebration
for all ages and all abilities and part of
[Greater Moorhead Days](https://www.fargomoorhead.org/event/greater-moorhead-days/).

This year's proceeds benefit the
[Rotary Ride Safe Program](http://fmrotaryfoundation.org/projects/rotary-ride-safe-program/)
which includes bike repair stations, bike racks, and bicycle safety
programs throughout the Fargo/Moorhead parks.

All ride routes start and end at Lindenwood Park Rotary Shelter near the
playground.

More information about this event is available at
