On November 19, 2018, Dr. Tony Phillips reported in his 
[A Sunspot from the Next Solar Cycle](https://spaceweatherarchive.com/2018/11/20/a-sunspot-from-the-next-solar-cycle/) article
that an ephemeral sunspot with a reversed magnetic field was detected by
Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory at 21:00 UT on November 17th, 2018.
This sunspot matches two previously reported spots and suggests that the
" slow transition between Solar Cycle 24 and Solar Cycle 25 appears to
be underway."[^1]
