>Newly elected ARRL CEO Howard Michel, WB2ITX, is still on the
>uphill side of the learning curve as he acquaints himself with ARRL
>Headquarters and the nearly 90 staffers who work there. The New Jersey
>native arrived at HQ on October 15 and has spent much of his time since
>meeting with department managers and others to get his bearings, with
>an eye toward building consensus and aligning people, programs, and
>services in the same direction.

>**Michel would like to see ARRL focus on the future of Amateur Radio and
>not become the redoubt of a particular generation of radio amateur or
>interest group**. He said, "Ham radio shouldn't abandon the old guardians
>of the hobby, but at the same time, it needs to have new things that
>appeal to people who have different interests and different passions." [^1]
