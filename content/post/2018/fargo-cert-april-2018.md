The Fargo Cass Public Health Emergency Preparedness & Response Division will
conduct
[Community Emergency Response Team \(CERT\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Emergency_Response_Team) training beginning April 3.
CERT is an All-Hazard approach to train and educate citizens in case of a
large or small-scale disaster. Following a major disaster, first responders
who provide fire and medical services will not be able to meet the demand for
these services. CERT training provides life-saving skills and techniques for
people who will rely on each other for help in the time of need.
