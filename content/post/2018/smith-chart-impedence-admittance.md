An introductory video by
[W2AEW]({{< relref "post/2018/smith-chart-impedence-admittance.md#about-w2aew" >}})
describing how complex impedance and admittance are represented on the
Smith Chart, and how to convert between them. Includes a demonstration using a
[VNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_analyzer_(electrical)
to illustrate the complex impedance representation on a live smith chart with
variable resistive and reactive components.)
