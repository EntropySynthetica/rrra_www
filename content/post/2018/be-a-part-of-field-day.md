## About Field Day

This event, dating back to 1933, gives members of the public, and
government officials, an opportunity to see Amateur Radio (AKA Ham
Radio) in action and to learn about the hobby and how it can support
their communities. It also gives Amateur Radio operators an opportunity
to learn about communicating in abnormal situations under less than
optimal conditions by setting up temporary stations utilizing field
expedient antennas and off-the-grid power such as solar or generators.
