title = "Jingle Bell Run Radio Operators Needed"

+++
Radio Operators are needed to provide public service communication
support for the
[2018 Jungle Bell Run]({{< relref "/calendar/2018/jingle-bell-run.md" >}})
on Saturday, December 1st.

Operators will be stationed along the course and should meet at
the [Courts Plus](/places/courts-plus-community-fitness/) fireplace at
8:15 AM to obtain their assignments. The race starts at 9:00 AM.

The Jingle Bell Run is an excellent opportunity for new Amateur Radio
Operators to familiarize themselves with event support net operations in a
relaxed setting.

Please contact {{% mailto KC0GQE %}}&nbsp;if you would like to volunteer for, or
have any questions about, this event.
