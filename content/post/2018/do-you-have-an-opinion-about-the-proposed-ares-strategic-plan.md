>Created in 1935, ARES has undergone very few changes over the years,
>while the agencies ARES serves have undergone many. The PSEWG evaluated
>the ARES program for 2 years and drafted several proposed enhancements
>aimed at updating the program.
>
>The ARES Strategic Plan introduces changes and a platform for future
>growth. For many, this will represent a major paradigm shift; for
>others, it will formalize many of the requirements they have employed
>routinely for several years. [^1]
