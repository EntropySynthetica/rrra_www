Amateur radio is the means of communication
with others on equal terms, of finding
friendship, adventure and prestige while
seated at one's own fireside.  In picking his
human contacts out of the air the amateur is
not seen by them.  He is not known by the
clothes he wears but by the signals he emits.
He enters a new world whose qualifications
for success are within his reach.  There are
no century-old class prejudices to impede his
progress. He enters a thoroughly democratic
world where he rises or falls by his own
efforts. When he is W9XYZ, a beginner, the
radio elders help him willingly, and when he
becomes W9XYZ the record-breaker and
efficient traffic-handler, he willingly helps
the younger generation. Without a pedigree, a
chauffeur, or an old master decorating his
living room he can become a prince---of the
air. At the close of the day, filed with the
monotonous routine of the machine age, he can
find adventure, vicarious travel, prestige and
friendship by throwing in the switch and
pounding his signals into the air.
