ARRL leadership policy and governance actions taken over the last two
years---along the actions planned to be formalized at the Board meeting
in January 19, 2018, in Newington---have become a source of concern,
among some members, about the future of the League. Enough concern was
raised that, "in December 2017, a small group of passionate, long-time
supporters of ARRL [including Life Members, Maxim Society Members,
Legacy Circle Members, Past Vice-Directors, and Volunteer Counsel] ...
banded together as [myARRLvoice](https://www.myarrlvoice.com/) to better
understand the issues, to educate the community and to advocate for
positive change." [^1]

Subsequent to the formation of myARRLvoice a
[Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/myarrlvoice/)
and [Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/myarrlvoice)
were established to provide venues for discussion about, and to raise
awareness of, these issues.

### The Issues

[myARRLvoice](https://www.myarrlvoice.com/) consider 
[these actions](https://www.myarrlvoice.org/the-issues/) to be issues of
concern:

>* The Amateur Radio Parity Act was renegotiated to favor HOA positions
>* The new ARRL [Board of Directors] Code of Conduct limits what you get to know
>* Your Director's voting power could be diminished
>* Your ARRL membership could be terminated for any reason
>* Vice Directors could have been eliminated from the ARRL
>* The ARRL Board's governance proposals have generated significant undisclosed legal fees
>* Your elected Director could be censured for describing the new ARRL Code of Conduct
>* Your candidate for Board of Directors could be disqualified without explanation [^2]
