The ["Significant Changes" article](http://www.arrl.org/news/significant-changes-in-store-for-ft8-and-msk144-with-wsjt-x-version-2-0) lists a potential WSJX-X 2.0 features---including ARRL Field Day operation with standard Field Day exchanges and A special *telemetry* message format for exchanging arbitrary information up to 71 bits---which, according to K1JT, will "work seamlessly and automatically ... No *contest mode* checkboxes are needed".[^1]

These new features will not be backwards compatible. "It will be essential for users to upgrade to version 2.0 in order to use the new features and communicate with others who have made the upgrade."[^2]
