On May 19, 2018, 22 Amateur Radio Operators---led by KD0IOE and
KC0SHM---provided
[public service](http://www.arrl.org/public-service)
communication support for the Fargo Marathon under the auspices of the Red
River Radio Amateurs club.

These operators were stationed at 19 locations across the Fargo /
Moorhead area. They tracked progress of the races and passed other
tactical traffic. Some of the operators are depicted in the
