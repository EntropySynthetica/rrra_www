It's time to start planning for the 2018 ARRL Dakota Division Convention
and RRRA Hamfest. This is the largest Hamfest in North Dakota drawing
attendees from 3 states and 1 Canadian province. Committee members
are needed to plan and run this major fund raising activity for our
club. Lots of volunteers will make the work easy for everyone.
[Planning meetings will begin June 10th]({{< relref "/calendar/2018/hamfest-committee-meeting-1.md" >}}).

The Hamfest Committee will use a mailing list for coordination and to
assist the planning process. A shared folder is available to committee
members at the <a href="https://cloud.rrra.org" rel="nofollow">RRRA
File Sharing Server</a> for document sharing and archiving.

Hamfest Committee volunteers are asked to
[subscribe to the hamfest mailing list]({{< relref "/post/2018/hamfest-committee-members-needed.md#subscribing-to-the-mailing-list" >}})
so that they can stay informed and be a part of the conversation.
**Returning volunteers must re-subscribe to the hamfest list to confirm
their participation.** <!--more-->Volunteers may subscribe multiple
addresses (e.g. work and mobile e-mail) if desired.

Please contact {{< mailto W0HNV >}} if you have any questions about this
event.
