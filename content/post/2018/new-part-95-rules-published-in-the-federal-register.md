Although
[these changes](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/29/2017-17395/personal-radio-service-reform)
are unrelated to Part 97 they will have an impact on Hams who use Part 95
services such as **FRS**, **GMRS**, and **CBRS** (formerly known as *CB*);
they will also affect advice given to Part 95 service users.
