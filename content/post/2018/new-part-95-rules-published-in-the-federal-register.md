The updated regulation is effective September 28, 2018.

<!--more-->
Perhaps the most significant regulatory change is the retroactive
re-classification of currently available hybrid FRS/GMRS *Blister Pack*,
or *Bubble Pack*, transceivers with an Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of
2 watts, or less, as FRS devices. This re-classification, in conjunction
with other changes to Part 95B, authorizes the license free use of these
low power transceivers on all built in channels (1--22) and increased the
power on certain FRS channels from 0.5 to 2 watts ERP.

Although
[these changes](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/08/29/2017-17395/personal-radio-service-reform)
are unrelated to Part 97 they will have an impact on Hams who use Part 95
services such as **FRS**, **GMRS**, and **CBRS** (formerly known as *CB*);
and who render advice to Part 95 service users.

### Summary from the Federal Register

>The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopted a
>comprehensive reorganization of and update to the rules governing
>the Personal Radio Services (PRS). PRS provides for a wide variety
>of wireless devices that are used by the general public for personal
>communication uses, which include applications like walkie-talkies,
>radio controlled model toys, Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs), medical
>implant devices and other uses. In addition to the comprehensive review
>and update of the rules to reflect modern practices, the Commission
>enhanced the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) to allow new digital
>applications, allot additional interstitial channels and extend the
>license term from five to ten years. It also allotted additional
>channels to the Family Radio Service (FRS) and increased the power on
>certain FRS channels from 0.5 Watts to two Watts. It also updated the
>CB Radio Service to allow hands-free headsets, removed a restriction
>on communicating over long distances and removed other outdated
>requirements. These changes and others outlined below will update PRS
>rules to be more in line with current public demands for the services
>and will make the rules easier to read and find information, while also
>removing outdated requirements and removing unnecessary rules. [^2]
