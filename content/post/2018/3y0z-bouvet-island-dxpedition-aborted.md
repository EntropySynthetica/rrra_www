>February 3, 2018, 2000 UTC: During the last 72 hours, we continued to
>experience the high winds, low clouds, fog and rough seas that have prevented
>helicopter operations since our arrival at Bouvet. No improvement was
>predicted in the weather forecast for the next four days. Then, last night,
>an issue developed in one of the ship's engines.
>
>This morning, the captain of the vessel declared it unsafe to continue with
>our project and aborted the DXpedition. We are now on our long voyage back to
>Punta Arenas. As you might imagine, the team is deeply disappointed, but safe.
>There is already talk about rescheduling the DXpedition [^1]
