Incident and event net traffic falls into two categories: formal message
traffic and tactical traffic. 

Tactical traffic consists of *ad hoc* messages about what is happening
during an incident or event. And the purpose of a tactical traffic net
is to enable all participating stations to pass traffic while it is
still relevant.

Efficient tactical traffic nets engage in succinct and unambiguous
communication through the disciplined use of a well practiced protocol
which eliminates *over identification* and avoids the introduction of
extraneous words.

One such tactical traffic net protocol is illustrated in a
[Tactical Communications Exercise](http://www.rickscholz.net/aen-mar/Recordings2/?name=2012-03-18_20120227__aenmar.mp3)
conducted during an 
 [AEN-MAR]({{< relref "post/2018/aen-mar-tactical-communications-exercise.md#about-aen-mar" >}})
net. In this recording you will hear net participants practicing their tactical communication protocol as they check-in, submit their reports, and engage in discussion.

>Channel bandwidth is a precious commodity on a tactical net. Remember,
a tactical net intends to move "right-now" messages while they're still
relevant. Extraneous words---especially when everybody starts adding
them out of habit---add up quickly to limit how much message traffic
can move across the net. They especially add up during check-ins or
when Net Control polls stations for reports. [The AEN-MAR Tactical
Communications Exercise net activity focuses] on and exercise[s] how to
hit your message and move on. Say more, clearly, with fewer words so
others can get their traffic passed, too [^1]
