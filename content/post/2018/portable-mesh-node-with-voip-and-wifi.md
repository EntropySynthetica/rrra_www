Purchasing an AREDN compatible radio and antenna is only the first step in
assembling a useful, deployable, personal node.

Additional parts and equipment to support planned network
capabilities---including provisions for portable power---must be
purchased and then packaged in a manner which allows for safe and
reliable operation.

[Trevor Paskett \(K7FPV\)](https://www.aredn.org/bio/K7FPV), a member of
the [AREDN](https://www.aredn.org/) project, has designed a a portable
mesh node to support his local mesh network's mission while meeting
served agency policy restrictions which prohibit permanent installation
of equipment in their buildings.

[K7FPV's portable node](http://www.trevorsbench.com/portable-mesh-node-with-voip-and-wifi/),
 documented in an article in the
[Trevor's Bench Blog](http://www.trevorsbench.com/), features:

* WiFi access to the mesh network
* Telephone service through a [VOIP Analog Telephone Adapter \(ATA\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_telephone_adapter) connected to the mesh network Asterisk server 
* Power for 5 days from a 122 amp hour deep cycle battery
* Battery charger/PSU for operation when commercial power is available
