FT8 is a new mode included in WSJT-X versions 1.8 and later.

This weak signal mode is intended---and optimised---for making efficient
*barebones* contacts; a definite plus during this time of poor
propagation. Although FT8 does not support rag-chewing or contesting
exchanges it is, none the less, well worth trying out in the Amateur Radio
spirit of learning and experimentation.

The slides from my presentation after the adjournment of the April 17,
2018, RRRA Business Meeting
are available for download from the **Training and Education
| Presentations** folder on the
[RRRA Groupware Server](https://cloud.rrra.org/).

### About FT8

>The new mode is named after its developers, Steven Franke, K9AN,
>and Joe Taylor, K1JT. The numeral designates the mode's 8-frequency
>shift keying format. Tones are spaced at 6.25 Hz, and an FT8 signal
>occupies just 50 Hz. Unlike JT65 or JT9, transmit and receive cycles
>in FT8 each last about 15 seconds. Like JT65, FT8 requires accurate
>time synchronization. An auto-sequencing feature offers the option to
>respond automatically to the first decoded reply to your CQ.
>
>"FT8 is an excellent mode for HF DXing and for situations like
>multi-hop Es on 6 meters, where deep QSB may make fast and reliable
>completion of QSOs desirable," Taylor's release notes assert. [^1]
