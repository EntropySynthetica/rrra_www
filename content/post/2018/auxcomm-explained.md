### About AUXCOMM

>***AUXCOMM*** is an umbrella term and acronym for *auxiliary
>communications*. It was developed by OEC in 2009 with the assistance
>of amateur radio subject matter experts.  The concept behind the acronym was
>to educate as many amateur radio entities to work and train with public
>safety personnel, understand the value of the National Incident Management
>System (NIMS) Incident Command System (ICS) concept and the role of the
>communications unit leader (COML). AUXCOMM, although not an official national
>ICS position as of yet, is most often identified as a Technical Specialist
>(THSP) in the Communications Unit of the NIMS ICS structure.  A few states
>have endorsed AUXCOMM as an official position within their state NIMS/ICS
>structure.  The process on how this can be accomplished is described in the
>FEMA NIMS:  Guidelines for the Credentialing of Personnel, August 2011 and
>FEMAs Type 3 All-Hazard Incident Management System Qualification Guide, dated
>September 2010. 
>
>OEC subsequently developed the AUXCOMM technical assistance workshop and
>produced the Auxiliary Field Operators Guide. This guide and other OEC
>products are available at http://www.publicsafetytools.info/. The TRG-AUXCOMM
>(again, another Federal acronym for the course designator) is designed to
>educate amateurs and state officials involved with volunteer groups they could
>expect in an emergency operations center environment.  The AUXFOG is a
>reference guide for the amateur radio emergency communications community.
>[As of July 2016] the OEC AUXCOMM course [had] been taught 105 times with over 1,300 amateur
>radio operators trained. [^1]

>Why use the term "AUXCOMM" when
>radio amateurs are historically familiar with the traditional
>groups/programs such as ARES&reg;, RACES, SATERN, REACT, etc? ... While
>participating amateurs are trained by their home groups, such as ARES,
>when activated under the ICS, they check their titles and any internal
>group rivalries at the door. Under ICS, they all become technical
>specialists/auxiliary communicators, Thus avoiding confusion on who they
>report to, and the protocols to follow. AUXCOMM is not an organization
>or program and does not compete with any Amateur Radio program or
>organization that provides public service, disaster, or emergency
>communications. [^2]
