## About SKYWARN&reg;

>The effects of severe weather are felt every year by many Americans.
>To obtain critical weather information, NOAA's National Weather
>Service (NWS), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, established
>SKYWARN&reg; with partner organizations. SKYWARN&reg; is a volunteer
>program with nearly 290,000 trained severe weather spotters. These
>volunteers help keep their local communities safe by providing timely
>and accurate reports of severe weather to the National Weather Service.
>
>Although SKYWARN&reg; spotters provide essential information for all
>types of weather hazards, the main responsibility of a SKYWARN&reg;
>spotter is to identify and describe severe local storms. In the average
>year, 10,000 severe thunderstorms, 5,000 floods and more than 1,000
>tornadoes occur across the United States. These events threatened lives
>and property.
>
>Since the program started in the 1970s, the information provided by
>SKYWARN&reg; spotters, coupled with Doppler radar technology, improved
>satellite and other data, has enabled NWS to issue more timely and
>accurate warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms and flash floods.
>
>SKYWARN&reg; storm spotters are part of the ranks of citizens who form
>the Nation's first line of defense against severe weather. There can be
>no finer reward than to know that their efforts have given communities
>the precious gift of time--seconds and minutes that can help save
>lives. [^1]
