The Fargo Cass Public Health Emergency Preparedness & Response Division will
conduct a summer
[Community Emergency Response Team \(CERT\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Emergency_Response_Team)
training beginning June 6. CERT is an All-Hazard approach to train and
educate citizens in case of a large or small-scale disaster. Following a
major disaster, first responders who provide fire and medical services
will not be able to meet the demand for these services. CERT training
provides life-saving skills and techniques for people who will rely on
each other for help in the time of need.
