Cass County will be issuing new Radio Operator ID Badges for RRRA ARES
participants. The issuance process for these badges includes a background
check.

While these badges are not required for participation in ARES, they
***will*** be required for certain ARES deployment positions.

In late 2019 the ID Card issuance process changed. The form originally
linked here is no longer valid.
