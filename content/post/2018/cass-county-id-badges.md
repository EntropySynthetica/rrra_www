Cass County will be issuing new Radio Operator ID Badges for RRRA ARES
participants. The issuance process for these badges includes a background
check.

While these badges are not required for participation in ARES, they
***will*** be required for certain ARES deployment positions.

RRRA members interested in acquiring a Cass County ID Badge, and who did not
complete the form distributed by KC0DCF at the May business meeting, must complete an
[ID Card Application and Background Check Consent form](https://cloud.rrra.org/index.php/s/IAt6lD08IQ1mc5D)
and return it at an upcoming
[business](/dates/business-meetings) or [ARES](/dates/ares-meetings) meeting.

Please contact {{< mailto KC0DCF >}} with any questions.
