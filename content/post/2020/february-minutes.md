### Old Business

#### Club Storage

Bob W0HNV reported the proposed indoor storage unit at U-Haul on
13<sup>th</sup> Ave has access from 5am-11pm. 24 hour access is
available for an extra $10/mo, but this is likely not needed. The club
can pay for 12 months and get one month free. Rental agreement renews
yearly. This space is $75 a month, which is about on par for other
facilities. Other sites did not have many indoor climate-controlled
units. Another site had climate controlled, but no drive-in access.
