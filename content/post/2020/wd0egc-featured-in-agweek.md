R. Jay Goos upcoming retirement from North Dakota State University (NDSU) has
been featured in two recent [Agweek](http://www.agweek.com) articles.

Goos' distinguished career at NDSU started in 1980 after he completed his
doctorate at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. "Until 2005,
Goos was primarily in research but taught one course in soil fertility.
When three professors retired suddenly, Goos took over the Introduction
to Soil Science class. Goos is the only professor in the NDSU College
of Agriculture to win the Senior Career Teaching Award twice---20 years
apart." [^1]

During his career Goos worked on fertilizer issues for a variety
of crops but, according to Agweek, is most known for his work on
iron-deficiency chlorosis ("IDC").

Goos is an active member of Red River Radio Amateurs club and teaches
their Technician level amateur radio license test preparation class. He
holds an Amateur Extra Class radio license and the FCC call-sign WD0EGC.

>western North Dakota and eastern Montana.&#93;
>
>...
>
>#### Chloride
>
>... For farmers in the Upper Great Plains, Goos and colleagues verified

>Goos studied and proved the effects of fertilizer additives to reduce
>the loss of fall-applied nitrogen over winters, especially in winters
>with heavy snowfall.
