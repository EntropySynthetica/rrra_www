W7HMT begins by mentioning that the 2012 Spectrum Act, which funded FirstNet, authorizes
supporting volunteer groups---including the Amateur Radio Emergency Service
(ARES&reg;)---access to dedicated spectrum in Band 14 (700MHz).

His article covers technical details of how FirstNet differs from commercial
cellular carriers and discusses advantages for ARES:

* How ARES teams can use cellular communication
* Assets to improve cellular resiliency
* Priority access to avoid cellular congestion
* Communicating directly with Served Agencies 

W7HMT then describes the process of he went through when subscribing to
FirstNet and provides a link for purchasing a FirstNet-ready smartphone.

In closing, W7HMT writes:

>Given the fact that FirstNet, like existing cellular networks, is
>subject to impairment during disasters, there remains a need for a
>resiliency that only amateur radio can provide. Nonetheless, FirstNet
>can be another valuable resource in the ARES toolkit, to help provide
>communications in times of disaster.[^1]
