On January 3, 2019, [K7UV](https://www.reddit.com/user/peteF64)
[started a discussion in the Amateur Radio sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/ejk1ez/solar_cycle_25_appears_to_have_begun/)
about a report by K7RA---in the first
[ARRL Propagation Bulletin](http://www.arrl.org/w1aw-bulletins-archive/ARLP001/2020)
for 2020---about indications that Solar Cycle 25 has begun; good news
for DXers and other Amateur Radio Operators who rely on the effects of
sunspots for propagation.

>Sunspots appeared recently, all indicating Solar Cycle 25 due to

>appeared December 24-26, and it looks like a new Solar Cycle 25 spot
>on January 1.  NOAA did not report it (too weak?) but
>Spaceweather.com reported a sunspot number of 11 on January 1.

>On January 2 NOAA reported the new spot with a sunspot number of 23.[^1]
