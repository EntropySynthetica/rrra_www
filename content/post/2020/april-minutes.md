## Regular Agenda

### Committee Reports 

#### Cass County RRRAES

Mark KK0V reported that the ARRL has created a volunteer hub. ARES
members are encouraged to sign up at nd.arrl.volunteerhub.com. Skywarn
courses are available online, link is at RRRA.org. An in-person Skywarn
class is scheduled for May, but the status of it is unknown at this
time. Members are encouraged to take the online Skywarn classes.

#### Clay RRRAES

Seth KC0ODE reported that Clay County ARES will also be encouraging
members to sign up through the Volunteer Hub. Details are forthcoming.
Fargo Police Picnic scheduled for June 23[rd] is still on as scheduled
for the time being.

#### Technical

Bob W0HNV was not present. Jarod W0JPJ mentioned that Bob is still
working on a new location for the former Wheatland repeater. They will
be looking for a liability waiver of some sort for any future repeater
site as well.

#### Education

Bob W0HNV was not present. No report.

### Hamfest

Pete WC0G reported that the fairgrounds are confirmed for September
19[th]. One speaker is lined up for sure, others are in the works.
Online tickets will be available this year. Price is going to also be
raised to $10. Volunteer efforts will need to ramp up soon. Anyone
wanting to help can reach out to Pete WC0G, Tiny WB0BIN, or Anton
KC0PFS.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported that testing is still scheduled for the May club
meeting. This will change if the May meeting ends up being on-air
instead. ARRL and W5YI are experimenting with remote testing as an
alternative to in-person testing.

#### Media

Steve K0STK was not present. Any questions about the website or
listserver please contact webmaster@rrra.org.

### Old Business

#### Skywarn

There are online opportunities for Skywarn training for anyone
interested. Link is available at RRRA website. An in-person class is
still scheduled for May 18[th] at West Fargo City Hall but that is
pending.

#### Communications Trailer Donation from Jeff KK7IX

No update

#### Communications Trailer Solar Upgrades

Mark KK0V approached the club regarding solar upgrades for the club
trailer. The club officers approved his request. Mark KK0V also
mentioned the trailer will need new batteries as well. He will get a
price and report back.

#### Club Domain Name Renewal

Steve K0STK mentioned to the club officers last month that the domain
name for the club website was up for renewal. The club officers agreed
to pay for one year and shop around for a better price next year. Will
get status update at next month's meeting.

### New Business

#### Fox Hunt

Kent KA0LDG sent an email to the club listserver about a potential
Fox Hunt. He has tentatively scheduled it for May 9[th]. He notes
this activity can be participated in while still maintaining a social
distance.

#### COVID-19 Affect on Field Day

Kent KA0LDG noted that Field Day as an event is still on, but the
large gathering that the club typically has will not happen due to the
COVID-19 situation. Members are encouraged to participate in Field Day
on their own.

### Good of the Order

Don KC0DCF mentioned the club does have a Memorandum of Understanding
with several organizations. That could potentially fill the liability
waiver need for a new repeater site.

### Adjournment

* Motion ito adjourn by Ken W0CZ
* Seconded by Don KC0DCF
* Meeting adjourned at 19:48
