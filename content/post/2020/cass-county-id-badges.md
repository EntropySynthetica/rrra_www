Instructions for requesting an ID Badge are available in the
[RRRA File Server](https://cloud.rrra.org/) (AKA *the cloud*) **ARES Folder**.

While these badges are not required for participation in ARES, they
***will*** be required for certain ARES deployment positions.

Please contact the {{< webmaster >}} for assistance with the RRRA
File Server.
