Sometime in mid-2021 the Federal Communications Commission
([FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/)) will complete their transition to
"electronic correspondence and will no longer print or provide wireless
licensees with hard-copy authorizations or registrations by mail." [^1]

[^1]: "FCC to Require Email Addresses on Applications", ARRL the national association for Amateur Radio, accessed December 10 2020, http://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-to-require-email-addresses-on-applications.

This transition will require all Amateur Radio licensees---both existing
and applicants---to provide a valid e-mail address on license applications. 
Licensees will also be required to maintain a valid e-mail address in their
ULS record in the same way that they must maintain a valid mailing address.

Part 97 &sect; 97.21 &para; (a)(1) will be revised to read, in part:

>(a) A person holding a valid amateur station license grant:
>
>(1) Must apply to the FCC for a modification of the license grant as
>necessary to show the correct mailing and e-mail address, licensee
>name, club name, license trustee name, or license custodian name in
>accordance with &sect; 1.913 of this chapter. ... [^7]

Part 97 &sect; 97.23 will be revised to read:

>Each license grant must show the grantee's correct name, mailing address, and
>e-mail address.  The e-mail address must be an address where the grantee can
>receive electronic correspondence.  Revocation of the station license or
>suspension of the operator license may result when correspondence from the
>the FCC is returned as undeliverable because the grantee failed to provide
>the correct e-mail address. [^6]

A announcement of this transition to electronic-only licensing
correspondence was adopted on September 16, 2020, in a Report and
Order
([R&O](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-adopts-electronic-licensing-report-and-order))
in the matter of *Completing the Transition to Electronic Filing,
Licenses and Authorizations, and Correspondence in the Wireless Radio
Services*:

>Today, we finalize our transition to electronic interactions for
>licenses in the Wireless Radio Services---a transition that began
>more than two decades ago. By doing so, we decrease the costs for
>consumers and the Commission, enhance transparency of and access
>to data, significantly improve administrative efficiency, and save
>a substantial amount of paper annually---to the benefit of the
>Commission and those who interact with these systems alike. [^2]

[^2]: "Report and Order FCC 20-126 &sect; I.2", Federal Communications Commission, accessed December 10 2020, https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-126A1.pdf.

>While the Commission corresponds electronically with applicants
>and licensees in some instances, there remains a large amount of
>paper communication generated by ULS and its supporting systems. The
>relevant applications and FCC Forms provide an opportunity for, but
>do not require, users to provide an e-mail address as part of their
>contact information. The Wireless Telecommunications and Public Safety
>and Homeland Security Bureaus (the Bureaus) by practice send paper
>correspondence generated by these systems to applicants and licensees,
>such as copies of licenses, reminder letters, and other courtesy
>notices. The Bureaus send thousands of these letters via U.S. Postal
>Mail each year. [^3]

[^3]: "Report and Order FCC 20-126 &sect; II.5", Federal Communications Commission, accessed December 10 2020, https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-126A1.pdf.

>Finalizing the Commission's transition to an electronic-only ULS and
>[Antenna Structure Registration (ASR) System], and reducing the paper
>created by other systems, requires us to take several remaining steps.
>First, we remove the remaining exemptions to mandatory electronic
>filing in ULS and require electronic filing in the ASR System. Second,
>we require electronic filing of pleadings related to Wireless Radio
>Services licenses and applications in these systems and require
>electronic service where service of such pleadings is required. Third,
>we require that all applicants, licensees, and registrants in the
>Wireless Radio Services include at least one valid e-mail address on
>the relevant FCC Forms. Fourth, we shift from U.S. Postal Service to
>electronic delivery of correspondence generated from these systems to
>applicants, licensees, and registrants in the Wireless Radio Services.
>And finally, we set a transition deadline of six months for these
>changes to take effect, [^4]

"The new rules will go into effect 6 months after publication in the Federal Register, which hasn't happened yet, but the FCC is already strongly encouraging applicants to provide an email address." [^5]
