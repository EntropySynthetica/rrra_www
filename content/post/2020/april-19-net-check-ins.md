Compare your signal strength---and voice quality---to your fellow
operators with this [recording from the
April 19, 2020, Sunday Night UHF/VHF Net](https://cloud.rrra.org/index.php/s/JEHfz9Ei5F24H4f)

This recording was made from the VHF side of W0ILO, Moorhead, and was
edited to include only unique participant check-ins. Duplicate check-ins
were included only where there was a substantial difference in signal
quality.

Check-ins missing (a portion of) the first word indicate that
insufficient time was allowed between the operator pressing their PTT
button and starting to speak.
