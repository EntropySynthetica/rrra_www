### About Foxhunting

Foxhunting is a radio activity which involves searching
for a transmitter using direction finding techniques.
Also known as [amateur radio direction finding
\(ARDF\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_direction_finding)
Foxhunting is one form of
[Radiosport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosport#Amateur_radio_direction_finding)
and is "popular in Eastern Europe, Russia, and China, where it was often
used in the physical education programs in schools." [^1]

[^1]: "Amateur radio direction finding", Wikipedia, accessed June 14 2020, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_direction_finding.

The skills practiced by Foxhunters are useful for locating
[Radio Frequency Interference \(RFI\)](http://www.arrl.org/radio-frequency-interference-rfi)
sources and
[Emergency Locator Beacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_locator_beacon).
