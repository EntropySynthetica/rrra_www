Thank-you to everyone everyone who volunteered to provide communication
support for 
[Walk MS: Fargo 2020]({{< relref "/calendar/2020/ms-walk-fargo.md" >}}).

Communication support is no longer needed because the National MS
Society has moved all Walk MS events---through June---to fully virtual
experiences.

These virtual experiences will continue support of life-changing
breakthroughs for people affected by MS while following current
social-distancing guidelines.

While The National MS Society's Walk MS experience may look different
this year, their mission does not. And as they face this time of
uncertainty, they are providing resources and working hard to develop
new ways to support people with MS.

# How You Can Help

* Celebrate Your Walk, Your Way ... Whether it's on a home treadmill or a walk around the block with your dog, on your site's Walk MS date (or whenever it's convenient for you) put on your orange or your favorite National MS Society volunteer t-shirt and show how you're celebrating by using #virtualwalkMS on social media to share photos and more

* Fundraising and Donations ... While we cannot gather in person, if you would still like to contribute to Walk MS, you may do so through fundraising or donating. We will continue to fundraise for Walk MS virtually to meet our goals and support people living with multiple sclerosis

* Call, text or FaceTime a person affected by MS in your life. Create a safe opportunity for connection. After all, we're all in this together!
