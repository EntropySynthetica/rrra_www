{{< mailto KA0LDG >}} has started an informal evening *Isolation Net* at 7PM,
Monday--Friday, on the
[W0ILO repeaters](/radios/).

This net is a great way to keep in touch each other during a period of
reduced physical contact and use our spectrum.

Check on the well-being of our fellow Hams and do things such as:

<!--more-->

* Ask for the help you need during this trying period
* Recount the Ham Radio activities you're engaged in while at home
* Share a new YouTube Ham Radio video you've watched
* Describe your shack
* Ask that question you can't find the answer for
* And more...

See you tonight!

The *Isolation Net* was [announced by
KA0LDG](https://lists.rrra.org/pipermail/rrra/2020-March/000774.html)
on Monday March 23, 2020, through the Club Discussions mailing list.

This net will be included on the [RRRA Nets](/nets/) list while it is
operational.
