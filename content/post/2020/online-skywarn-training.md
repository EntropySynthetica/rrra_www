Current SKYWARN&reg; Weather Spotters, and those interested in joining
the programme, may wish to take advantage of the on-line resources
available through the [National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office
Grand Forks, ND SKYWARN page](https://www.weather.gov/fgf/skywarn).

These resources are especially valuable during a time when *Social
Distancing* guidelines prevent the presentation of in-person classes.
