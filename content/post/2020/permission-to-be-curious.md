discusses a fundamental aspect of out hobby.

>The activities that our community places under the banner of amateur radio
>are many and varied. I've referred to this as a thousand hobbies in one. If
>you look at the surface, you'll find all manner of activities that readily
>attach to our hobby.
>
>Activations for example are invented at any opportunity, from parks to peaks,
>light houses, bridges, trains, boats, lakes, roads, locators and countries. We
>pursue contesting, making contacts using different modes, different power
>levels, we pick the frequencies on which we operate.
>
>If you dig a little deeper you might consider investigating propagation, or
>antenna builds, electronics, physics and more.
>
>It occurs to me that there is an underlying activity, one that any amateur can
>participate in and most do at what ever level they choose.
>
>It's the act of being curious. [^1]
