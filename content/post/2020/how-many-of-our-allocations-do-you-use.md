Amateur Radio in the United States has

How many of these allocations do ***you*** use?

Take a look at a specially highlited version of the
[NTIA United State Frequncy Allocation
Chart](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/page/2011/united-states-frequency-allocation-chart)---created
by Reddit user

see our allocations (except for the 2200M and 630M bands).
