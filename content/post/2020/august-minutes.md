## Regular Agenda

### Committee Reports 

#### Cass County RRRAES

Mark KK0V reported the FCC did finally make a decision regarding the 3.5
GHz band. Based on the initial reports, our existing AREDN gear in that
band should still be okay to use. Mark also talked to Amanda at Cass
County regarding the ID Cards and they are still working on it.

#### Clay RRRAES

Seth KC0ODE had nothing to report. Jarod W0JPJ reminded everyone to get
signed up for the new Cass/Clay alerts system, as Code Red is being
phased out. Info is available on the club website.

#### Technical

Bob W0HNV was not present.

#### Education

Jay WD0EGC reported the West Fargo Public Library has offered one of
the larger rooms for classes, but he and Bob W0HNV have decided to wait
until the COVID situation clears. The author of the education materials
does not want any online classes conducted with his material. Brad
KE0LDS added that he is looking to starting an online class up through
his church with different material. Contact Brad if interested.

### Hamfest

Pete WC0G remined everyone the Hamfest is cancelled. Lynn W0ND has
indicated he still wants our hamfest to be the state convention again in
2021. We are locked into our rate at the fairgrounds for two more years.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported they are still in a holding pattern. A special
session can be arranged if there is a facility large enough to maintain
a social distance and enough VE's to cover. Ken W0CZ suggested having
several smaller sessions.

#### Media

website or listserver please contact webmaster@rrra.org.

interest.
