The proposed charges:
<!--more-->
* Application for new license: $50
* License modification (e.g. upgrades): $50
* License renewal: $50
* Vanity application: $50
* Administrative update (address change, etc.): free

"Note that [these fees] would apply *per license* in the ULS, so if you
maintain a club callsign, it would cost the same amount for the club
application and renewal."[^2]

While an application fee may help solve the problem of people hoarding
1x2 and 2x1 call-signs it will increase the cost of participating in
our hobby. And it may have unintended consequences such as causing an
increase in unlicensed operation.
