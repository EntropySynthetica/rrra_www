### About this recording

This recording was captured from the VHF side of W0ILO, Moorhead, during
the RRRA *On-Air* Club Meeting on June 16, 2020, with an Alinco DJ-G7
Handheld Transceiver and the Audacity audio editor and recorder.

Audio level measurements were determined using the Audacity "Contrast"
analysis feature on each check-in; clicks generated by squelch opening and
closing, the post transmission noise burst, and the courtesy tones were
omitted from the level analysis. These measurements were made before the
recording was normalized.

### Post-production

* Equalization to remove content below 140Hz and above 2.8KHz

* Processing with the Audacity "Pop-Mute" plug-in to reduce the magnitude of
the squelch artifacts present at the beginning and end of each transmission

* Replacement of silence exceeding 1.25 seconds between check-ins with 1 second
gaps using the Audacity "Truncate Silence..." effect

* Truncation of the NCS Operator's opening announcement

* Normalization of the entire track to -1dB ; no level adjustments were
made to individual check-ins

* Encoding in MP3 format in Variable Bit Rate Mode (quality level 6:
95--135 kbps)
