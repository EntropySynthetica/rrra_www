Comments are due by January 18, 2020, in reponse to the
[Facilitating Shared Use in the 3.1-3.55 GHz Band \(FCC 19-130\)](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-19-130A1.pdf)
and
[Use of the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band \(FCC 19-129\)](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-19-129A1.pdf)
Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) which will affect current Amateur Radio allocations in
these bands.

All Amateur Radio Operators are encouraged to
[submit comments]({{< relref "/post/2020/comments-on-3ghz-and-5ghz-reallocation-due-by-january-18.md#how-to-comment" >}})
against these reallocations and in support of current Amateur operations in the bands to the FCC.

The
[Facilitating Shared Use in the 3.1-3.55 GHz Band](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-19-130A1.pdf)
NPRM proposes "to eliminate ... the non-federal amateur allocation
in the 3.3-3.5 GHz [as] an initial step toward potential future shared
use between federal operations and flexible use commercial services, in
furtherance of [the FCC's] obligations under the
[MOBILE NOW Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s19/text)
to identify spectrum for mobile and fixed wireless use and to work with
NTIA to evaluate this band for potential shared use."[^2]

A discussion of the comments desired by the FCC is presented on the *Future of Incumbent Non-Federal Operations* section on
[page 5 of NPRM FCC 19-130](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-19-130A1.pdf).

The
[Use of the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-19-129A1.pdf)
NPRM proposes to make spectrum available for
[Cellular Vehicle to Everything \(C-V2X\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_V2X)
operations as requested by the
[5G Automotive Association \(5GAA\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_Automotive_Association) by
by authorizing C-V2X in a 20Mhz segment of this band.

The NPRM notes "that the Amateur Service also shares the 5.9 GHz band through a secondary allocation [and proposes] that no additional rules are necessary to accommodate co-channel C-V2X use with the Amateur Service. [And the FCC proposes] that no additional rules are necessary to protect C-V2X devices from ISM operations permitted under Part 18 of our rules in the 5.850-5.875 GHz portion of the band. [The FCC seeks] comment on these proposals."[^3]

Comments on both of the NPRMs are due thirty (30) days after their publication in the Federal Register;
[their publication date was December 18, 2019](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/12/18/2019-27224/open-commission-meeting-thursday-december-12-2019).
Commenters are urged to read the NPRMs before writing their comments to ensure they are effectively on-topic.

### Why Bother Commenting?

First the FCC came for our allocation in the 11M band<br />
And I did not speak out<br />
Because 11M wasn't harmonically related to the other HF bands<br />

Then the FCC refused to stand up to HOAs regarding installation of effective outdoor antennas<br />
And I did not speak out<br />
Because I was smarter than other hams did not live under an HOA<br />

Then the FCC came for our allocations in the 3GHz and 5GHz bands<br />
And I did not speak out<br />
Because data networks are useless and they are not ***real*** ham radio anyway<br />

Then the FCC banned ARES <br />
And I did not speak out<br />
Because I'm only interested Contesting and Rag Chewing<br />

Then the FCC suspended Part 97 because there's no financial benefit to Amateur Radio<br />
And there was no one left<br />
To speak out for me <br />
