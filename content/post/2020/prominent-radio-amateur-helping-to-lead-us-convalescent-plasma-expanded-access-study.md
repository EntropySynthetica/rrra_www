>Scott Wright, K0MD, has been "substantially" stepping back from ham
>radio while offering his expertise to the US convalescent plasma
>[COVID-19 Expanded Access Program](http://www.uscovidplasma.org/).

>Joyner, MD, of the Mayo Clinic; Dr. Peter Marks, MD, PhD and Dr.

>"The US Convalescent Plasma Expanded Access Program is a collaborative
>project between the US government and the Mayo Clinic to provide access
>to convalescent plasma for patients in the US who are hospitalized
>with COVID 19," Wright told ARRL. The work has been referenced during
>White House press briefings and in congressional testimony. The US
>government-supported study collects and provides blood plasma recovered
>from COVID-19 patients, which contains antibodies that may help fight
>the disease. The Mayo Clinic is the lead institution for the program.
>
>"My role was to organize the infrastructure and the research approach,
>and to help lead the set-up of the data collection and of the website
>teams, while overseeing the study conduct and regulatory compliance,"
>Wright explained. [^1 ]
