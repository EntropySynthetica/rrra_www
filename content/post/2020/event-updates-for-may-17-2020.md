### West Fargo SKYWARN Class POSTPONED

The SKYWARN&reg; class scheduled for May 18, 2020, has been postponed
because West Fargo City Hall is not open to the public.

The date of the rescheduled class is not yet known. Attendees should be
prepared for a video conference (e.g. "Zoom") event.

Current SKYWARN Weather Spotters, and those interested in joining the
programme, should use the on-line training resources
available through the [National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office
Grand Forks, ND SKYWARN page](https://www.weather.gov/fgf/skywarn) to
prepare themselves for this upcoming class.
