## About SKYWARN&reg;

>In most years, thunderstorms, tornadoes and lightning caused hundreds
>of injuries and deaths and billions in property and crop damages. To
>obtain critical weather information, the National Weather Service (NWS)
>established SKYWARN&reg; with partner organizations. SKYWARN&reg; is
>a volunteer program with between 350,000 and 400,000 trained severe
>weather spotters. These volunteers help keep their local communities
>safe by providing timely and accurate reports of severe weather to the
>National Weather Service.
>
>Although SKYWARN&reg; spotters provide essential information for all
>types of weather hazards, the main responsibility of a SKYWARN&reg;
>spotter is to identify and describe severe local storms. In an average
>year, 10,000 severe thunderstorms, 5,000 floods and more than 1,000
>tornadoes occur across the United States.
>
>Since the program started in the 1970s, the information provided by
>SKYWARN&reg; spotters, coupled with Doppler radar technology, improved
>satellite and other data, has enabled NWS to issue more timely and
>accurate warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms and flash floods.
>SKYWARN&reg; storm spotters are part of the ranks of citizens who form
>the Nation's first line of defense against severe weather. There can be
>no finer reward than to know that their efforts have given communities
>the precious gift of time--seconds and minutes that can help save
>lives. [^1]
