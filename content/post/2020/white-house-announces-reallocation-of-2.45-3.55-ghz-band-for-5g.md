"The White House and US Department of Defense (DOD) have revealed that
the 3.45-3.55 GHz band will be made available for 5G, a move that has
been welcomed by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai." [^1] This reallocation is a 25%
loss of [9cm band spectrum](http://www.arrl.org/frequency-allocations)
to our hobby.

In an FCC News Release dated August 10, 2020, Chairman Pai issued this
statement:

>I commend the President and Department of Defense for today's
>announcement that the 3.45--3.55 GHz band will be made available for commercial
>5G deployment.  This is a key milestone in securing United States leadership
>in 5G.  I also would like to thank FCC staff for their work to help create a
>framework that will promote 5G service in this important band.  Together with
>the spectrum being made available for 5G in the C-band as well as the 3.5 GHz
>band, we are now on track to have a 530-megahertz swath of mid-band spectrum
>available for 5G from 3.45 to 3.98 GHz.  The FCC looks forward to moving
>quickly to adopt service rules for the 3.45 GHz band and then hold an auction
>to bring this prime mid-band spectrum to market. [^2]
