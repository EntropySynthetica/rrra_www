## Regular Agenda

### Committee Reports 

#### Cass County RRRAES

Mark KK0V reports the flood outlook continues to look better. If weather
continues we should get by very well. RRRA has not been contacted by
Emergency Managers regarding COVID-19. No further rulings from the FCC
regarding the 3.5GHz band.

#### Clay RRRAES

Jarrod W0JPJ reported that COVID-19 has taken precedence over flood
prep. Luckily the flood situation has improved. Joe K0JTR, the main
ARES coordinator Minnesota, is looking for a new District 3 Emergency
Coordinator. Steve K0STK added that the forms to receive new ARES badges
[are] online via the RRRA cloud site.

#### Technical

Bob W0HNV is waiting for weather to improve to get back up to Grandin to
work on that site.

#### Education

Bob W0HNV reported the tech class is cancelled due to the West Fargo
Library being closed due to COVID-19.

### Hamfest

Pete WC0G reported the committee is just starting to ramp up to being
preparations. Volunteers are needed. One seminar is booked, one more is
needed. Contact WC0G if interested.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported the next testing session is in May (March's was
cancelled due to COVID-19). If there is interest in a special testing
session an additional one may be scheduled.

### Old Business

#### Skywarn

These dates have changed due to COVID-19. Keep an eye on club website
for new dates once they are made available.

### New Business

#### Communications Trailer Donation

Jeff KK7IX has donated a trailer to the club. It is 4ft x 5ft x 5ft. It
has solar panels, cable pass throughs. Once the land it is currently
parked on dries up, he will give it to us. Jeff's generosity is very
much appreciated. A location to store it will need to be identified.

#### Fargo Marathon

Seth KD0IOE reported the marathon has been rescheduled (tentatively) to
August 29th. Since it will be warmer out there may be a greater need for
our services.

### Good of the Order

a meeting on air, despite the changing coronavirus situation.
