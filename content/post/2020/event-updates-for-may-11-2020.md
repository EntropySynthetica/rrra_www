### May Meetings Changed and Testing Session Canceled

The RRRA May meetings can not be conducted *in-person*---and the May
License Testing Session can not occur---because West Fargo City Hall is
not open to the public.

RRRA President (Jarod W0JPJ) was quoted saying, "*we will plan for
an on-air or Zoom-type meeting [for May]*", in a message distributed
through the
[Club Announcements](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/announce)
and
[Club Discussions](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra)
mailing lists on Monday, May 11, 2020.
