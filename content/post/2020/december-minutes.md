### Committee Reports 

#### Cass County ARES

Mark KK0V reported all ID badges have been distributed. Anyone still
needing one should see the instructions on the cloud website. Members
wanting to participate in ARES are encouraged to get the new enhanced
ID badge.

There was an issue with West Fargo Fire losing communications at
their south station, and they requested our assistance to restore
communications. Jim N0TSZ was able to get them setup with an antenna.
This will be a temporary fix until they get up and running with their
ARMER system. Mark noted in the process of this he determined we will
need to replace the lead acid batteries in the trailer as they have
gotten old.

Seth KC0ODE was not present. Jarod W0JPJ noted our I Am Responding
account is up for renewal.

a new replacement repeater for Grandin ready by tomorrow. Del N0IPC will
be passing through Crookston and will pick it up from John. We are still
looking for a new site in Western Cass County replace the Wheatland
repeater. Jake K0RQ mentioned he may have a lead on a tower site near
Embden but there may be a technical limitation. Jarod W0JPJ mentioned we
would be willing to donate his spare DMR repeater for the Harwood site.
We may also be able to add a repeater in Horace.

Zoom that should finish up next week.
