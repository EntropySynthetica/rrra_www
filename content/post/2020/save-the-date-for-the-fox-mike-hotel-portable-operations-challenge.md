There's a new contest debuting October 3--4, 2020 for portable Amateur
Radio Operators, and those living under onerous HOA restrictions
or the realities of limited real estate: the
[*Portable Operations Challenge*](http://foxmikehotel.com/challenge) (POC).
Potential participants are encouraged to add this event to their calendars and
review the [Operator Resources]({{< relref "/post/2020/save-the-date-for-the-fox-mike-hotel-portable-operations-challenge.md#operator-resources" >}}).

This contest---developed by Frank Howell, K4FMH---is "aimed at leveling the
competitive playing field between fixed stations and portable stations"[^1]
through the use of a scoring system which gives portable stations a *handicap*
advantage. In the words of the contest founder:

>The **POC** aims to make portable operations "on par" with more
>typical QTH-based operations while preserving the enjoyment of being in a new
>operating environment. Moreover, QTH-based operators can also easily
>participate in the action, challenging the handicapped-scoring for portable
>ops. Can the Super Station contester best the Little Pistol portable
>operation? If we use a scoring metric that reduces the advantages of
>QTH-bound stations to that of pure radio sport operating, is there a chance
>that an efficient portable operator or team can come out ahead of the current
>winning contest station operators? That's why this is called the
>**Portable Operations Challenge**![^2]

The Grand Prize Donor for the POC is [MFJ Enterprises](https://mfjenterprises.com/).

The POC is endorsed by four Amateur Radio Entities:

* [ARRL National Contesting Journal](http://www.arrl.org/ncj)
* [UK DX Foundation](http://www.cdxc.org.uk/)
* [South African Radio League](http://www.sarl.org.za/)
* [Hellenic Amateur Radio Association of Australia](http://www.haraoa.com/)

Despite the ARRL NCJ endorsement, this contest is neither an ARRL nor an NCJ
official event.

### Operation Time Limit

POC Operators must adhere to the contest operation time limit posted on the
[contest page](http://foxmikehotel.com/challenge/):

> Contest operation time---8-hour contiguous window within the
> 48-hours---chosen by the contestant to suit the appropriate region
> in the world where the entrant resides. The organisers wish the
> contestants to consider all dangers in the time window that they chose
> (e.g. putting up or taking down a portable station in the dark is not
> recommended). Operation outside of this 8-hour window contacting other
> POC competing stations is not allowed and will be controlled through
> log checking---this is to avoid entrants "cherry picking" of the best
> 8 hours from their log should the contestant operate a longer period
> than 8 hours in the POC. Contestants must also work within any local
> regulations, such as those to control the COVID-19 pandemic.[^3]

This limit is also discussed on page 1 of the
[POC rules document](https://foxmikehotel.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/POC-rules-v1.04.pdf).
