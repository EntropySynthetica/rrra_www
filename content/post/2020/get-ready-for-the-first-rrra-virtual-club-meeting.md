Many months have passed since RRRA members were forced by the COVID-19
pandemic to replace face to face club meetings with a monthly directed
net. Fortunately this isolation will be somewhat ameliorated at 7pm on
Tuesday, December 15, 2020, with the first
[RRRA Virtual Club Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2020/december-meeting.md" >}})
which will be conducted through the Zoom teleconferencing service.

RRRA members are encouraged to prepare and test their communications
equipment ahead of time so that they are ready for this opportunity
see each other again. A Zoom test meeting is available at
[https://zoom.us/test](https://zoom.us/test) for users to check their
equipment.
