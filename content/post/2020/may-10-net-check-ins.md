### About this recording

This recording was captured from the VHF side of W0ILO, Moorhead, during
the RRRA Sunday Night VHF/UHF Net on May 10, 2020, with an Alinco DJ-G7
Handheld Transceiver and the Audacity audio editor and recorder.

Prior to publication the recording was:

* Processed with the Audacity "Pop-Mute" plug-in to reduce the magnitude of
the squelch artifacts present at the beginning and end of each transmission

* Edited to to present just the check-ins---from squelch opening to
closing---in the sequence they occured with a 1 second gap between
check-ins

* The NCS Operator's opening announcment *was* truncated

**No level adjustments were made to the received signal during the
editing process.**
