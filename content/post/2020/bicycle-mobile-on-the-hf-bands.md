In his 
[Bicycle Mobile on the HF Bands](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/QST/This%20Month%20in%20QST/August2020/BRAVO!.pdf)
article ([a free preview from the August 2020 issue of QST Magazine)](http://www.arrl.org/this-month-in-qst),
Christian Bravo, W4ALF, discusses "an easy way to implement a mobile radio
system, for the operator on two wheels." [^1]

>After experimenting with pedestrian mobile and being active with Summits on
>the Air (SOTA), I was looking for a new amateur radio challenge. My
>experiences with portable ham gear led me to the idea of adapting my mobile
>setup to fit on my bicycle. The two-wheel setup would allow me to be even
>more mobile, and still be able to communicate on the HF bands. [^1]

[W4ALF's article](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/QST/This%20Month%20in%20QST/August2020/BRAVO!.pdf) covers:

* The Radio Setup
* The Bike
* Mounting the Antenna
* Performance

The **Mounting the Antenna** section of the article goes into detail about
W4ALF's tapped coil shortened vertical antenna with a raised counterpoise,
including a description of the Buddipole pieces used for the vertical.

In closing, W4ALF states:

>Operating bicycle mobile is a fun way to get out and operate while
>getting some exercise. Gear today lends itself well to having a
>high-performing HF setup on the go with two wheels. My antenna system
>allows for more bands and radials while operating stopped at a location
>without having to hang antennas. I hope the ideas presented here spark
>your own mobile adventures and homebrew modifications. [^1]
