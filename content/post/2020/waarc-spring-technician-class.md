[Wadena Area Amateur Radio Club](http://wadenaham.org/) will be hosting
a Technician Class this spring to get more people involved in the
wonderful hobby of amateur radio. This class is free and will run 6
weeks with a License (aka *VE*) Testing Session on the 7th week.

<!--more-->

Classes will be held from 6:30pm until 9pm on Tuesdays. The first class
session will be on Tuesday, March 24th. During the 7th week we will have
a testing session open to the public on May 4th.

These classes will be held at the
[Wadena-Deer Creek High School, 600 Colfax Ave SW, Wadena, MN 56482](https://goo.gl/maps/EucDQWS9rxsZUwKj7);
in the upstairs Media Center Classroom. WDC School has been so wonderful
to allow us to host our 2nd class there in conjunction with Community
Education.

The textbook for these classes is the
[ARRL Ham Radio License Manual \(4th Edition\)](http://www.arrl.org/shop/Ham-Radio-License-Manual/)
which may be purchased on-line (e.g.
[ARRL Store](http://www.arrl.org/shop/Ham-Radio-License-Manual/),
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ARRL-Radio-License-Manual-Spiral/dp/1625950829/))
or at any major bookstore. The classes will follow the format of this textbook.
