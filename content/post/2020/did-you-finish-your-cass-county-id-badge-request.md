The answer is an emphatic **NO** if all you've done is turn in a paper
form at an RRRA meeting.

Applying for a Cass County ID Badge is now a two step process which
requires the completion of two forms. One of these forms ***must*** be
completed on-line.

You will not receive your ID Badge until you complete both steps of this
process.

Instructions---and helpful hints---for requesting an ID Badge are
available on the [RRRA Groupware Server](https://cloud.rrra.org/) (AKA *the
cloud*) in the **ARES folder**.

You should see the **ARES folder** on your main files page after logging
in to the RRRA Groupware Server. Use the search box (next to the magnifying
glass icon) in the upper right hand corner of the screen to search for
*ARES* if you can't find the folder.

Please contact the {{< webmaster >}} for assistance with the RRRA
Groupware Server.
