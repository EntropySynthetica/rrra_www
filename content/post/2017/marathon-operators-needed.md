The time of year is upon us again for the 2017 Fargo Marathon!

In partnership with local emergency responders, RRRA will once again be
providing the communications backbone for the Marathon aid stations.
For those that have volunteered in the past, the course is very similar
to last year's. One main difference is starting inside the
Fargodome instead of out on University.

Please see the
[Fargo Marathon 2017]({{< relref "/calendar/2017/fargo-marathon.md" >}})
page for the event schedule, equipment list, etc.

RRRA communications support for the Fargo Marathon will be coordinated through
the
[Marathon Mailing List](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/marathon).
So all operators who wish to volunteer for this event must subscribe to the
Marathon Mailing List; even those who who signed up on paper at the May club
meeting.
