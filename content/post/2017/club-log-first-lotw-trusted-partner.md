[Club Log](https://secure.clublog.org/loginform.php) is the
[first logging service to achieve Trusted Partner&trade; status](http://www.arrl.org/news/club-log-is-now-a-logbook-of-the-world-trusted-partner)
for Logbook of the World&reg;
([LoTW](http://www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world)). This
means that LoTW users (i.e. Hams who have acquired an LoTW certificate) are
now able to upload directly from Club Log to LoTW (with integrated QSL signing)
rather than having to seperately upload their logs to both services.
