Our served agencies are accustomed to utilizing *direct* (i.e.
person-to-person) and virtually instantaneous communications to conduct
their operations. These means of communication (e.g. the telephone,
email with attachments, and instant messaging through a wide variety
of platforms) depend upon extensive, and often fragile, infrastructure
which can be disrupted during incidents ranging in scale from a
localized fiber-optic cable cut to regional severe weather events.

As past FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate,
KK4INZ, said in
[Ham Radio Now Emcomm Extra #8]({{< relref "post/2017/hamradionow-interview-with-craig-fugate.md" >}}),
 when an incident occurs "they just want their email to work."

Traditional public service (aka *Emcomm*) messaging often does not
meet the expectations of today's served agencies (our customers).
Amateur Radio operator typically utilize *indirect* communication paths
with paper forms for origination / delivery and transcription style
transfer methods (e.g. voice or CW); this does not provide the style of
communication preferred by our customers.

Some improvements in public service messaging have been
realized through the development of the
[Narrow Band Emergency Messaging Software](http://www.arrl.org/nbems)
(NBEMS) Open Source software suite which allows Amateur Radio Operators
to transfer data such as small files, text-only emails, and
[ICS Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_Command_System#FEMA_ICS_Fo
rms)
over RF without requiring networking infrastructure. Although NBEMS
*can* eliminate the requirement for manual transcription during message
transfer, because data and messages may be delivered to radio operators
on common interchangable digital media such as
[USB drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive)
it suffers from the limitation of being an *indirect* form of
communication and may still fall short of our customers' expectations.

[AREDN](http://aredn.org/) (the Amateur Radio Emergency
Data Network), which has been on the agenda at recent club meetings,
provides a way for way for Amateur Radio to meet our customers' needs for
*direct* communications through a high-speed IP data network. AREDN uses
a redundant, and resilient, **radio** mesh to provide a TCP/IP medium when
other network infrastructure has failed.
