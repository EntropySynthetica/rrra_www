[Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) is [Amateur
Radio](http://www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio)'s *open house*.
It is a picnic, a campout, practice for emergencies, an informal contest and,
most of all, *fun*!

## About Field Day

Field Day is held on the 4th weekend in June; in 2017 that
is 7:00PM CDT Friday, June 23rd, to 6:59PM CDT Sunday, June 25th. 

This event, dating back to 1933, gives members of the public, and
government officials, an opportunity to see Amateur Radio (AKA Ham
Radio) in action and to learn about the hobby and how it can support
their communities. It also gives Amateur Radio operators an opportunity
to learn about communicating in abnormal situations under less than
optimal conditions by setting up temporary stations utilizing field
expedient antennas and off-the-grid power such as solar or generators.
