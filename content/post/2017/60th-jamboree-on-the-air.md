"Jamboree-on-the-Air, or JOTA, is the largest Scouting event in the world. It
is held annually the third full weekend in October. JOTA uses amateur radio to
link Scouts and hams around the world, around the nation, and [across
communities]."

## Participating as an Amateur Radio Operator

>Contact your local Scout council and see what may already be planned
>in your area and how you can help. You can find your council using the
>[Council locator](http://www.scouting.org/LocalCouncilLocator.aspx).

>If nothing is currently planned, or if current plans aren't reaching
>your area, you can work with the council or a local unit (pack, troop,
>crew) to set up a JOTA station or arrange for visits to your ham
>shack. You can also participate just by making QSOs with the many JOTA
>stations that will be on the air. A good resource to find a local Scout
>unit is the
