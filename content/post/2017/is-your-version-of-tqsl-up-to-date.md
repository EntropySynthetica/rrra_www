"As of 1400 UTC on January 16, ARRL Logbook of The World (LoTW) no longer will
accept contacts that have been digitally signed by versions of TQSL earlier
than version 2.0. Users of earlier versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon
as possible, as older TQSL versions contain uncorrected defects and display
inaccurate error messages."[ [1]({{< relref "is-your-version-of-tqsl-up-to-date.md#footnotes" >}}) ]
<!--more-->
TQSL for MacOS and Microsoft Windows may be installed from the
[LoTW Installing or Upgrading TQSL](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/installation/)
page.

TQSL source code for Linux, and other unix-like operating systems, is
available from the Installing or Upgrading TQSL page. Prepackaged versions of
TQSL (both binary and source) may be available through your Operating System
(or "*distribution*") package management system.
