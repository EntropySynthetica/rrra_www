"BY70-1 is a 2U CubeSat project for education and Amateur Radio. It features
3-axis stabilization and deployable solar panels. In addition to the FM
transponder, BY70-1 has a camera, and plans call for downloading images and
telemetry via a 9600 bps BPSK downlink. The IARU Amateur Satellite Frequency
Coordination pages list an uplink of 145.920 MHz, and a downlink of 436.200
MHz."[ [1]({{< relref "#footnotes" >}}) ]
