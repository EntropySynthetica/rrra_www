Inexpensive Chinese radios, such as those produced by
[Baofeng Technologies](https://baofengtech.com/)
are popular as starter radios due to their low cost.
They are also used as disposable or spare/back-up radios.

This article describes the disassembly process and includes a video
of the tear down. It also includes circuit board photographs, a schematic
diagram, block diagrams of the major components used in the radio, and links
to data sheets for those major components.
