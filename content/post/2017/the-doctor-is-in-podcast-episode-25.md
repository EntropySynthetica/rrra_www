"In radio or wireless telephony, *Private Line* is a term trademarked by Motorola to describe their implementation of 
[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Tone-Coded_Squelch_System)
(CTCSS), a method of using low-frequency subaudible tones to share a single
radio channel among multiple users."

Learn about the technical background of this squelch tone system in the
