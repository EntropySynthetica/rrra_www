title = "Determine Antenna Orientation With An Azimuth Map"
+++
One easy way to determine the best orientation for your antenna is to
use an azimuth map; a world map which has been set so that all the
directions on that map are real antenna directions from one central
point.

These maps allow you to see the compass bearing from your QTH to other DXCC
entities.

Free azimuth maps may be generated using these on-line services:

* [Azimuthal Map page](https://ns6t.net/azimuth/azimuth.html) - NS6T
* [AJ_PROJ Map Generator](http://www.wm7d.net/az_proj/az_html/azproj.shtml) - WM7D
