## About SKYWARN&reg;

>The effects of severe weather are felt every year by many Americans. To obtain
>critical weather information, NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS), part
>of the U.S. Department of Commerce, established SKYWARN® with partner
>organizations. SKYWARN® is a volunteer program with nearly 290,000 trained
>severe weather spotters. These volunteers help keep their local communities
>safe by providing timely and accurate reports of severe weather to the
>National Weather Service.
>
>Although SKYWARN® spotters provide essential information for all types of
>weather hazards, the main responsibility of a SKYWARN® spotter is to identify
>and describe severe local storms. In the average year, 10,000 severe
>thunderstorms, 5,000 floods and more than 1,000 tornadoes occur across the
>United States. These events threatened lives and property.
>
>Since the program started in the 1970s, the information provided by SKYWARN®
>spotters, coupled with Doppler radar technology, improved satellite and other
>data, has enabled NWS to issue more timely and accurate warnings for
>tornadoes, severe thunderstorms and flash floods.
>
>SKYWARN® storm spotters are part of the ranks of citizens who form the
>Nation's first line of defense against severe weather. There can be no
>finer reward than to know that their efforts have given communities the
>precious gift of time--seconds and minutes that can help save lives.
