## About CERT

>The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program educates
>volunteers about disaster preparedness for the hazards that may impact
>their area and trains them in basic disaster response skills, such as
>fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization, and disaster
>medical operations. CERT offers a consistent, nationwide approach to
>volunteer training and organization that professional responders can
>rely on during disaster situations, which allows them to focus on more
>complex tasks. Through CERT, the capabilities to prepare for, respond
>to and recover from disasters is built and enhanced.

>At the same time, the CERT program was designed as a grassroots
>initiative and specifically structured so that the local and state
>program managers have the flexibility to form their programs in the
>way that best suits their communities. CERT volunteers are trained to
>respond safely, responsibly, and effectively to emergency situations,
>but they can also support their communities during non-emergency events
>as well. There are over 2,700 local CERT programs nationwide, with more
>than 600,000 individuals trained since CERT became a national program.

>FEMA's Community Emergency Response Team Program trains volunteers
>to prepare for the types of disasters that their community may face.
>Through hands-on practice and realistic exercises, CERT members:

> * Learn how to safely respond to manmade and natural hazards
> * Help organize basic disaster response
> * Promote preparedness by hosting and participating in community events
> * [Find a CERT program near you](https://www.citizencorps.fema.gov/cc/searchCouncil.do?submitByZip)
