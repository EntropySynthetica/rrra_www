The [Forx Amateur Radio Club](http://wa0jxt.org/) 146.940 repeater has been
replaced with a newer model GE Mastr III. It now has a CTCSS tone of 123.0 hz,
and is operating at an output power of about 55 Watts. A preamp has been
installed to improve the repeater's receive sensitivity.

Thanks to John Vik, KB0BSJ, for donating the repeater; and to everyone who
helped with the installation.
