This transceiver, a descendent of the
[BITX bidirectional 20M SSB QRP transceiver for homebrewers](http://www.phonestack.com/farhan/bitx.html),
was announced on March 2, 2017, by Ashhar Farhan (VU2ESE) in the

### Manufacture

>The uBITX boards are hand-assembled by a collective of women [based in Hyderabad, India]. Each of the toroids is hand wound. This provides these women with livelihood. The assembled boards are then DC checked and a final RF check is performed to check the receiver's sensitivity as well as transmitter's output before being shipped. Each board is individually numbered.
