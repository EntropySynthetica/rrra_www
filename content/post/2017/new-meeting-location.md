After meeting for more than 19 years at the Cass County Annex
building (in a space which was previously the Cass County Emergency
Operations Center) the Red River Radio Amateurs are moving to the
[West Fargo City Hall](/places/west-fargo-city-hall/).

The March [ARES Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2017/march-ares-meeting.md" >}}),
[Club Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2017/march-meeting.md" >}}), and
[Testing Session]({{< relref "/calendar/2017/march-testing.md" >}}) will be
held at club's new meeting location. Attendees should enter through the north
doors adjacent to the 4th Ave E parking lot.

The Red River Radio Amateurs would like to thank the City of West Fargo for
providing them with a new meeting location and the Cass County Government
for hosting them in the past.

Please read the [about our club](/about/) page to learn more about the Red
River Radio Amateurs.
