## About the Chase

>The objective of the ARRL International Grid Chase is simple: Work stations in as many grid squares as possible and upload your log data to ARRL's Logbook of The World. If you are not currently registered with Logbook of The World, this is a good reason to get started. Go to https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/getting-started/. Registration and uploading are free.

>Every new grid square contact confirmed through Logbook of The World counts toward your monthly total, so you have an incentive to start the chase as soon as you ring in the New Year.

## 630 and 2200 Meter bands may be used

>ARRL Contest Branch Manager Bart Jahnke, W9JJ, has clarified that the
new 630- and 2200-meter bands **will** be fair territory in the
[ARRL International Grid Chase](http://www.arrl.org/aigc2018).

>US radio amateurs are advised, however, that the use of 630 and 2200
meters requires
[advance notification](https://utc.org/plc-database-amateur-notification-process/)
to the Utilities Technology Council
([UTC](http://utc.org/)),
formerly the Utilities Telecom Council, of their intention to operate
on one or both bands. If UTC does not respond within 30 days or
specifically denies access, these stations may commence operation there.
