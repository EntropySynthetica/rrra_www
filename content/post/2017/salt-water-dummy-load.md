A [dummy load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_load)
is a piece of equipment which allows transmitter testing and adjustment with minimal radiation of RF energy.

Most dummy loads are constructed using
[non-inductive resistors](https://www.kanthal.com/en/products/resistors-and-capacitors/bulk-ceramic-resistors/tubular-resistors/)
and utilize various heat sinking methods, ranging from passive air cooling
(e.g. [Elecraft DL-1](http://www.elecraft.com/mini_module_kits/mini_modules.htm), [MFJ-261](https://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-261))
to submersion in non-conductive oil baths
(e.g. [Heathkit Cantenna](http://beachpackagingdesign.com/boxvox/the-heathkit-cantenna), [MFJ-250](https://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-250)), to dissipate the transmitter power.

An inexpensive, and easy to assemble, home brew alternative to
conventional dummy loads is the
[K5LXP Saltwater Dummy Load](http://www.qsl.net/k5lxp/projects/SaltLoad/SaltLoad.html)

{{< figure src="http://www.qsl.net/k5lxp/projects/SaltLoad/SaltLoad.jpg" >}}

The article provides construction and alignment instructions along with an
network analyzer [SWR plot](http://www.qsl.net/k5lxp/projects/SaltLoad/SWRPlot.GIF)
and a graph of [thermal performance](http://www.qsl.net/k5lxp/projects/SaltLoad/TempRise.gif) for 100w input over 30 minutes.
