### Discovery Event
Stop the Bleeding-Evert Paterson Captain in the Fargo Fire Department.
Certified trainer in Stop the Bleeding.

The new focus is an old idea, the tourniquet has gone through studies and has
been shown to control bleeding without loss of limbs.  The stats on deaths
from uncontrolled bleeding is staggering.  Most deaths from uncontrolled
bleeding occur before the patient reaches the hospital.  The course is a 2
hours long and has been adopted by the military, government agencies, and
other agencies as the best practice.  Mr. Paterson stressed the need to have
people take this class.  It is offered on a per need basis. Cost for training
is minimal, but it covers trainer's time, certificates, etc.    

### Good of the Order
