[A recent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/5d2q2o/experience_with_quansheng_not_legal_for_amateur/)
on the [Amateur Radio subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/)
addresses the spectral purity of one reader's Quansheng TG-UV2 HT.

This HT was connected to a IFR Systems AN920 Spectrum Analyzer (<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMi8k54uYKPAuWr_RtvpwpvpGB3t2ZgooTy5UktGgiWqQOipwA1gO1_MuB-rttHtw/photo/AF1QipN7qZg__sk9teBfHi1zcd4MORESVp1CMpKNSMEB?key=dU9ic1l0Nm5WSUFqR1g4Tmp1LTFHcmFfd2tQdEF3">view full size image</a>.)

The results of this test led the owner of the radio to conclude that
it was not compliant with Part 97 and, therefore, not legal to use for
Amateur Radio.

Part 97 Subpart D Section 97.307(e) states: "The mean power of any
spurious emission from a station transmitter or external RF power
amplifier transmitting on a frequency between 30-225 MHz must be at
least 60 dB below the mean power of the fundamental. For a transmitter
having a mean power of 25 W or less, the mean power of any spurious
emission supplied to the antenna transmission line must not exceed 25
ÂµW and must be at least 40 dB below the mean power of the fundamental
emission, but need not be reduced below the power of 10 uW."[[2]({{< relref
"#footnotes" >}})]

Regardless of whether or not the conclusions in this case are correct,
as licensed Amateur Radio operators we are individually responsible
for ensuring that our equipment complies with the spectral purity
requirements of Part 97.

Is *your* radio in compliance?
