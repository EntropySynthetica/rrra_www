### About The Ride

This is the fourth annual cycling celebration for all ages and all abilities
and part of
[Greater Moorhead Days](http://www.fargomoorhead.org/calender-detail.html?eventid=14608).

Four different fun [ride routes]({{< relref "#routes" >}}) start and end at Lindenwood Park Rotary Shelter.  

This vibrant community event and fundraiser has raised money to support the FM Miracle Field, a rubber-surfaced baseball field in Moorhead, and Gigi's Playhouse Fargo, a Down Syndrome Achievement Center. 

Five local Rotary Clubs host this all-volunteer event along with support from Great Rides.
