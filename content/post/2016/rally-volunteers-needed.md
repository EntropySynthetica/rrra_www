Volunteers are still needed in all specialties for the 2016 Headwaters
Rally on May 21. They have a new venue this year, the Northern Lights
Casino in Walker, MN. The stages will be run in the Paul Bunyan forest.

The Headwaters Rally is a single-day event that runs in the afternoon.
Volunteers may avoid a hotel stay by driving up in the early morning
and driving home again that night. For those choosing to stay,
the rally organizers have arranged have a great deal with the
Northern Lights Casino for rooms at just $80 per night. Just call
<a href="tel:2185472744">(218) 547-2744</a> and ask for the "Headwaters
Rally Block".

The rally includes 8 stages with 2 stage crews, so most volunteers
will get to see 4 stages! Rally organizers predict the largest turnout
in years, with 25 cars already registered: "It's going to be a great
event." [Online registration is now open](http://www.rallymasterpro.com/workers/?group=1)

On the 21st, worker registration will be open from 9:00 to 11:00 AM
at the Northern Lights. There will be a brief worker meeting at 11:30
before leaving for the woods. Be sure to bring food and water for the
day, along with extra insect repellant! Everyone will return to the
Northern Lights for the awards banquet before dark.

Registration is also open for the 2016 Ojibwe Forests Rally, August
26-27, in Detroit Lakes, MN. Top drivers from across the country will be
competing for the national championship. You'll surely want to see the
fabulous night stage through the streets of Detroit Lakes!
