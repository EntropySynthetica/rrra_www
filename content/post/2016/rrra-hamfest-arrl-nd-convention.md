#### What to bring to the exam session
Please see the ARRL's [What to Bring to an Exam Session](http://www.arrl.org/what-to-bring-to-an-exam-session) page to learn about what to being to this exam session.

Candidates who do not bring the required documentation (i.e. indentification, FRN **or** SSN) and payment ($15 cash or check) will not be able to test.

First time candidates are encouraged to apply for, and use, their [FRN](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=about_getting_started#d36e21) as doing so makes it easier to find your new license in the FCC's [Universal Licensing System (ULS)](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=home). 

License class upgrades require [supporting documentation of current license
status](http://www.arrl.org/what-to-bring-to-an-exam-session). Copying
facilities will **not** be available at the testing site.
