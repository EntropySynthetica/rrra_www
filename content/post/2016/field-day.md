[Field Day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) is an annual [Amateur
Radio](http://www.arrl.org/what-is-ham-radio) exercise, dating back to
1933, which is an educational event, an operating event, and a public
relations event. This event is held on the 4th weekend in June; in 2016 that
is June 25th and 26th. 

Field Day gives Amateur Radio (AKA Ham Radio) operators an opportunity
to learn about communicating in abnormal situations under less than
optimal conditions. Hams practice these these communication skills by 
setting up temporary stations, often in public locations, and attempt to
contact as many other Amateur Radio stations as possible. These temporary
stations frequently utilize field expdient antennas and _off-the-grid_ power
such as solar or generators.

<!--more--> Field Day also gives members of the public, and government
officials, an opportunity to see Amateur Radio in action and to learn
about the hobby and how it can support their communities.
