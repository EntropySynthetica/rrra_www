>SKYWARN&trade; Recognition Day was developed in 1999 by the National Weather
>Service and the American Radio Relay League. It celebrates the contributions
>that SKYWARN volunteers make to the NWS mission, the protection of life and
>property. Amateur radio operators comprise a large percentage of the SKYWARN
>volunteers across the country. The Amateur radio operators also provide vital
>communication between the NWS and emergency management if normal
>communications become inoperative. During the SKYWARN Special Event operators
>will visit NWS offices and contact other radio operators across the world.
