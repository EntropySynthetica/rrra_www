The on-line Monthly Reports for RRRA Committees should be available in the
*Committee Reports* folder on the
[RRRA ownCloud server](http://cloud.rrra.org/).
<!--more-->
Follow these steps to view the on-line reports:

1. Visit the RRRA ownCloud server by either entering its address
(http://cloud.rrra.org) in your browser's location bar, or by clicking the
*cloud* (<span class="genericons-neue genericons-neue-cloud")>&nbsp;</span>) social media icon below the RRRA logo in the upper left corner of any
page on [our website](http://rrra.org/)

1. Enter your ownCloud username and password in the dialog box in the center of the ownCloud log-in page then click the right arrow (<span style="font-weight:bold" class="genericons-neue genericons-neue-next">&nbsp;</span>) at the end of the password line, or press your *Enter* key, to log-in

    <span class="genericons-neue genericons-neue-star">&nbsp;</span> If you have forgotten your ownCloud password you may attempt to reset it by clicking the *Wrong password. Reset it?* message which will appear under the username/password box following a failed log-in attempt.

    <span class="genericons-neue genericons-neue-warning">&nbsp;</span> This reset capability is only available if you have entered a valid e-mail address in your ownCloud personal information page

1. Click the *Committee Reports* folder name on the ownCloud home-page to "open" the folder. Inside it you'll see a sub-folder for each committee; click on a committee folder name to open that folder

1. Click on the name of the report you wish to read.  If you're unable to view a report in your browser, or just wish to download it, click the ellipsis ( <span style="font-weight:bold">&#8230;</span> ) to the right of the report name and select *Download* from the pop-up menu

Please contact the {{< webmaster >}} if you need any assistance 
viewing the on-line reports (e.g. never received username/password, can't reset password, nothing works, etc.)
