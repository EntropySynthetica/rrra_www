>ARRL once again is calling on its members to urge their US Senators to
support the
[Amateur Radio Parity Act (H.R. 1301)](http://www.arrl.org/amateur-radio-parity-act)
when it comes up in the
Senate during the "lame duck" session of Congress that adjourns in
mid-December. The House of Representatives approved the bill in September,
but if the Senate does not follow suit, the bill will die, and the entire
process will have to be repeated. ARRL Hudson Division Director Mike Lisenco,
N2YBB, who chairs the ARRL Board's Legislative Advocacy Committee and has
been heavily involved in efforts to move H.R. 1301 forward, said today,
"The clock is ticking!"
