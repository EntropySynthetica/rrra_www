September is National Preparedness Month.  Every year in September 
[ARRL](http://arrl.org) encourages
[ARES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Radio_Emergency_Service),
[RACES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Amateur_Civil_Emergency_Service),
and [SKYWARN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywarn)
leaders to plan a
[Simulated Emergency Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_Emergency_Test)
(SET). In their effort to be as prepared as possible to provide auxiliary
communications if needed during a disaster, the RRRA ARES group has
planned an informal nets
[Sunday, October 2nd]({{< relref "calendar/2016/simulated-emergency-test-1.md" >}}) ,
and
[Monday, October 3rd]({{< relref "calendar/2016/simulated-emergency-test-2.md" >}})
on VHF and HF bands with relays between these bands handled by the net
controllers.

The purpose of this North Dakota (ND) SET is to allow those who are
interested a chance to participate and to determine what communication
links are possible in the event of a disaster. If this SET is deemed a
success future SETs will be planned including additional times, other
bands, sending messages and emergency scenarios.

The ND SET will occur between 13:00 and 14:00 CDT on
[Sunday, October 2nd]({{< relref "calendar/2016/simulated-emergency-test-1.md" >}}) ,
and
[Monday, October 3rd]({{< relref "calendar/2016/simulated-emergency-test-2.md" >}}) using the following frequencies:

* [W0ILO Repeaters](/radios/)
* 146.52 Mhz (2m) simplex FM
* 3.860 Mhz (75m) LSB, the ND net frequency; net control will be
[W0HSC](http://www.w0hsc.org/) at [NDSU](https://www.ndsu.edu/).

Hams interested in auxiliary communications are encouraged to participate in both, or at least one, of the sessions.
