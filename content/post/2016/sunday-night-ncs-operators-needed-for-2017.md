title = "Sunday Night NCS Operators Needed For 2017"

+++
Net Control Station (NCS) Operators are needed for the 2017 [Sunday Night
VHF/UHF nets](/dates/ncs-schedule/).

NCS operators call the net to order at its designated start time,
periodically call for participants to join, listen for check-ins, keep
track of the roster of stations for that particular net session, and
generally orchestrate the operation of the net.
<!--more-->
A [Net Preamble]({{< relref "nets/preamble.md" >}}) (or script) is provided
to aid NCSes in operating their nets.

Serving as an NCS is a great way to overcome *mic-fright*, prepare for
Public Service Communication events or deployments, and hone your skills
as a radio operator.

Our Net Coordinator, {{< mailto KD0TGA name >}}, will be putting the
2017 NCS roster together during December 2016.

Please contact {{< mailto  KD0TGA >}} if you have any questions or to
volunteer as an NCS for the 2017 season.
