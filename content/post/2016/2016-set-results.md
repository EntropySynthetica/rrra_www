The ARRL Simulated Emergency Test (SET), conducted on October 1st and
2nd, 2016, was a national emergency exercise "aimed at testing the
skills and preparedness of Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) and
other organizations that are called into action in actual emergency
situations."[[1]({{< relref "/post/2016/2016-set-results.md#footnotes" >}})]

During the 2016 SET the Red River Radio Amateurs (RRRA) conducted tests
of HF and VHF coverage in the Red River Valley. The Net Control Stations
periodically polled the [W0ILO repeaters](/radios/), the VHF National Calling
Frequency, and 
3.860MHz, logging the call-signs and
locations of check-ins.

No logs are available for the HF portion of the SET. However, according to a
statement by KC0DCF at the October 2016 RRRA business meeting, HF operations
were not conducted at NDSU as planned due to equipment issues. Mark KK0V
operated HF from home and logged 5 contacts.

The coverage areas logged on VHF by K0CRF (operating as W0ILO) included:

* North Fargo
