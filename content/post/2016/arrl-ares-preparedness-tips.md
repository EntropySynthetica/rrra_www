**Memory check**: When was the last time you updated the memories in
your HT? Verify the settings are still good, or add new frequencies that
are relevant to your area

**The ICS**: All hams involved with oublic service
communications should know the basics of the Incident
Command System (ICS). FEMA has lots of ICS info available at
[www.fema.gov/incident-command-system-resources](http://www.fema.gov/incident-command-system-resources)

**Check that coax**: Old coax can deteriorate over time. Regularly
test all coax runs and jumpers used in the field to ensure they will
work when you need them

**Portable power**: Make sure you have a portable 12V DC power
source available for your radio. Many options exist, but a portable car
jump starter is an excellent choice that has multiple uses

**Share your skills**: Mentoring others strengthens ham radio
preparedness in your area and reinforces your knowledge of what you
teach. Somebody once taught you; keep that cycle going

**Get on the air**: Any skill set gets rusty if not used. Get on the
air regularly for recreation. Not all ham radio is an emergency, and ops
who are regularly active are more prepared if an emergency arises

**Learn to look up**: Skywarn teaches you how to relay critical
weather info to the National Weather Service during a storm. Find a
class near you at
[www.nws.noaa.gov/skywarn/](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/skywarn/)

**If you build it, you will learn**: When you make something
yourself, you will better understand how it works. Building is a great
club activity; have your club sponsor a "Build Night." The skills you
learn make you a better troubleshooter in the field

**Be adaptable**: Always keep a wide selectio of antenna and audio
adapters in your Go-Kit. You never know what gear you may encounter in
the field; maximize your flexibility

**ARRL training**: If you want to get serious about Emergency
Communications, ARRL courses will give you the foundation you need to
suceed. Learn more at
[www.arrl.org/emergency-communications-training](http://www.arrl.org/emergency-communications-training)

**Raise your app awareness**: Get smart about smartphone
apps for emergency preparedness. FEMA and Red Cross apps
are great, but there's much more. Study up on apps at
[www.emergencymgmt.com/training/Emergency.Management.App.html](http://www.emergencymgmt.com/training/Emergency.Management.App.html)

**Catch a (radio) wave**: Communication becomes easier when you
know what band fits your needs. Learn how to determine the best band for
getting a message to where it needs to go

**Lighten your load**: A lighter Go-Kit means more agility. Weigh
your gear. If you're carrying more than 20 pounds of ham radio gear, try
to cut weight without sacrificing capability. Be critical

**Weather-wise**: Program your local National Weather Service
frequencies into your VHF/UHF radio. Weather can change in an instant,
as evidenced by the sudden formation of Tropical Storm Julia along the
Florida/Georgia coast on Septenber 13th, 2016. Be informed!

**Blow your horn**: The Public Information Officer (PIO) tells the
mocal media how your club bebefits your community. This raises your
club's visibility and fosters relationships with served agencies. If
your club does not have a PIO, get one!

**Other organizations**: VOAD is a national-level
organization of other groups dedicated to helping in times of
need. Learn how your group can be of service at the state level.

**Here comes sunshine**: Solar power is free and plentiful. It
can charge your batteries, but it can also be a source of noise.
Learn the ins and outs of solar power to keep you on the air and
noise-free during Field Day, after a hurricane, or the wake of a flood.

**Field Day isn't just for June**: Every time you operate portable,
you gain valuable experience to use during an emergency or disaster
situation. Use the fun of programs like National PArks on the Air to
practice your deployment skills

**Go social**: Social media is the communication and networking
tool of today. Learn to [do] it to promote what your group does to your
community and served agencies. [bit.ly/2cCv60S](http://bit.ly/2cCv60S)

**Master new modes**: Phone may not be able to get the message out.
Learn how to use modes other than voice, such as CW or digital modes
like PSK. The more ways you know how to communicate, the more valuable
you are on a deployment

**Go over your Go-Kit**: Does your Go-Kit have intermittent issues?
Been a while since you cleaned it out or did maintenance? Take an
evening to go through your Go-Kit from top to bottom; minor problems
become big issues at the worst possible times

**Safety first**: Whether a routine demonstration or a natural disaster,
always operate with safety in mind. Corson off areas with bright tape, keep a
first aid kit on hand, and **always** steer clear of downed power lines. Don't
become another victim!

**Access to alkalines**: Keep a supply of alkaline batteries available.
They can provide power to many HTs in the event you can't recharge your normal
power pack. They come in handy for hundreds of other applications, too. If
stored longterm, check regularly for leakage

**Know your gear**: Do you know how to use all the features your radio
offers? Extra memories, special filtering and other settings can make working
stations easier and reduce fatigue on long shifts, Sit down with the manual
and try out all your rig can do

**What else can you do?**: Many of us have more skills than
communication. When working with other agencies, let them know if you have any
other certifications (CPR, IT, etc). You never know how you may be asked to
help; make yourself valuable!

**Learn from the master**: If you need to learn a new procedure or skill,
ask an expert to teach you. Whether handling a soldering iron or increasing
your efficiency as Net Control, working directly with those who have the
know-how will get you up to speed; soon, you will be doing well

**Find those fuses**: Keep a supply of fuses for all your devices in your
kit. Don't let a blown fuse keep you from staying on the air during a
deployment

**Pack cheat sheets**: Be sure to document how your Go-Kit is laid out.
You may have a guest op, or forget how to perform a specific function. Bring
manuals with you, or condensed versions of them. You could store PDFs of them
on your phone, too

**Ready...SET...Go!**: The Simulated Emergency Test Oct 1 & 2 gets your
group involved in one of the nation's largest training exercises. If you
aren't involved, contact your local Emergency Coordinator or member of the
ARRL Field Organization

**Frequent flyers**: Whenever you are out with Amateur Radio in a public
setting, keep a supply of promotional flyers on hand. You never know when you
will get a chance to promote what we do! Free brochures are available at
