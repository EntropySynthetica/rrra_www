The [first planning meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2016/hamfest-committee-meeting-1.md" >}}) for the the 2016 ARRL Dakota Division Convention
and RRRA Hamfest will be held on Sunday, 24 Jul 2016 at 15:00 CDT.
This is the largest Hamfest in North Dakota drawing attendees from
3 states and 1 Canadian province.

Committee members are needed to
plan and run this major fund raising activity for our club. Lots of
volunteers will make the work easy for everyone; so all RRRA members who
are interested in helping with the 2016 Hamfest are encouraged to
attend.
