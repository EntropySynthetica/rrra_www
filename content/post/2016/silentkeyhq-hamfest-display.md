One of the tables at the 2016 RRRA Hamfest & ARRL ND State Convention
was a display about the
[National Silent Key Archive](http://www.silentkeyhq.com/)&trade;
featuring North Dakota Amateur Radio Operators from before 1946; back
when our prefix was "W9."

This display was created, and manned, by Gordon Bean, K8MRS, of St.
Charles, Michigan.

Gordon introduced convention goers to the National Silent Key
Archive&trade; and handed out information sheets which encouraged fellow
radio amateurs to submit known silent keys to the Archive.

### About the National Silent Key Archive&trade;

>The National Silent Key Archive&trade; is a digital library that protects
>and preserves photos, data, and stories about our deceased friends and
>family members who served Amateur Radio and the communities where we
>live. With a successful National Silent Key Archive, Silent Key data
>will be preserved and available for the Amateur Fraternity.
>
>The success of the Archive depends mostly on the willingness Amateur
>Radio Operators to volunteer small segments of time to submit
>photographs, obituaries, and life event narratives of their deceased
>Amateur Radio friends and family members. The scope of what the National
>Silent Key Archive hopes to accomplish requires much more dedication
>and time than a single individual can put forth. Through the efforts
>of many, however, the National Silent Key Archive&trade; can become an
>outstanding and respected Amateur Radio historical reference.
