The RRRA Hamfest Committee is in need of volunteers to help run the 2019 RRRA
Hamfest and ARRL Dakota Division Convention.

Many hands ***do*** make light work. And every contribution is important
regardless of how large it is. So please give some thought to how **you**
can help out. 

<!--more-->

These positions need to be filled so RRRA can have a sucessful and  smooth
running event.

### Admission Table

* Table Leader - A volunteer who is in charge of the operation of
the front door admission table; leader of the *Table Crew*

* Table Crew - 4 or more volunteers to work at the front door admission table.
This crew will be selling tickets to attendees and answering their questions.
The table will be staffed in shifts; more volunteers means shorter shifts and
more opportunities for everyone to enjoy the event

### Kitchen Crew

* Helpers to assist in operating the Hamfest/Convention food service. No
cooking experience is needed. More volunteers means shorter shifts for everyone
involved

### Silent Key Memorial Table

* Table Coordinator - A volunteer who assembles the RRRA Silent Key
Memorial honoring Silent Keys since the 2018 Hamfest and ensures it is
set-up in the Hartl Building main hall. Information about our Silent
Keys is available at https://rrra.org/sk/ and additional resources (e.g.
photos) are available from [webmaster@rrra.org](mailto:webmaster@rrra.org)

### Set Up Crew

* Volunteer helpers who assist in setting up the rooms used for the Hamfest/Convention in
the Hartl and Schollander buildings. This crew traditionally meets for lunch
at Deaner's Diner at Noon of the set-up day (Friday, September 27th)

### Tear Down Crew

* Volunteer helpers who assist in clearing and cleaning the Hartl and
Schollander building rooms. The published Hamfest/Convention ending time is
2PM, but the event usually starts to *wind down* shortly after 1PM
