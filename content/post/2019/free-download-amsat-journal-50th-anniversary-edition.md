### About AMSAT

>The [Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSAT)
>(as AMSAT is officially known) was first formed in the District
>of Columbia in 1969 as an educational organization. Its goal
>was to foster Amateur Radio's participation in space research
>and communication. AMSAT was founded to continue the efforts,
>begun in 1961, by Project OSCAR, a west coast USA-based group
>which built and launched the very first Amateur Radio satellite,
>[OSCAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_satellite), on
>December 12, 1961, barely four years after the launch of Russia's first
>Sputnik.
>
>Today, the "home-brew" flavor of these early Amateur Radio satellites
>lives on, as most of the hardware and software now flying on even
>the most advanced AMSAT satellites is still largely the product
>of volunteer effort and donated resources. Though we are fond of
>traditions our designs and technology continue to push the outside of
>the envelope.
>
>For over 50 years AMSAT groups in North America and elsewhere have
>played a key role in significantly advancing the state of the art in
>space science, space education, and space technology. Undoubtedly, the
>work now being done by
> [AMSAT volunteers](https://www.amsat.org/volunteer-for-amsat/)
>throughout the world will
>continue to have far-reaching, positive effects on the very future
>of both Amateur Radio, as well as other governmental, scientific and
>commercial activities in the final frontier. Rarely have a group of
>"amateur" volunteers managed to do so much...for so many...with so
>little.[^1]
