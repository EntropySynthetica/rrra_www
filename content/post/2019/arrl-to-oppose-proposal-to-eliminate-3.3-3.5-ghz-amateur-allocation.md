This NPRM, which threatens our use of the 24 non-shared channels on 3.4
Ghz in our RF mesh network
([AREDN](https://www.arednmesh.org/))---along with other Amateur Radio
use of this band---is the result of the 
[MOBILE NOW Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s19/text),
[reintroduced to the 115th congress by U.S. Senator John Thune \(R-SD\)](https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/1/thune-reintroduces-mobile-now-act-on-first-day-of-115th-congress),
chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
on January 3, 2017, and ultimately
[signed into law by President Trump on March 23, 2018](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2018/3/president-signs-mobile-now-act-other-key-technology-bills-into-law).

>According to an FCC
>"[Fact Sheet](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-360941A1.pdf),"
>the proceeding WT Docket 19-348, "Facilitating Shared Use in the
>3.1--3.55 GHz Band," is a follow-on from the MOBILE NOW Act, approved
>by the 115th Congress, which requires the FCC and the US Department of
>Commerce to make available new spectrum for mobile and fixed wireless
>broadband use. It also requires the FCC to work with the National
>Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to evaluate
>whether commercial wireless services and federal incumbents could share
>spectrum between 3.1 and 3.55 GHz.[^2]

The *MOBILE NOW Act*---discussed in a [U.S. Senate Committe on Commerce, Science, & Transportation press release](https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2018/3/president-signs-mobile-now-act-other-key-technology-bills-into-law)---is
intended to "[boost] the development of next-generation gigabit wireless
broadband services, including 5G, by ensuring more spectrum is identified for private sector use"[^3]
and includes numerous amendments focused on unlicensed spectrum and meeting
consumer demands for telecommunications services.

Also on the FCC's agenda for it's December 12th meeting is consideration
of an ***NPRM*** in WT Docket 19-138 which could affect the amateur
radio 5-centimeter allocation from 5.650--5.925 GHz. "ARRL also will
file comments opposing any changes affecting the 5-centimeter amateur
allocation."[^4]

The legislation and ***NPRMs*** discussed in this article should serve
as a reminder to Amateur Radio Operators of the importance of 
[joining the ARRL](https://www.arrl.org/join-arrl-renew-membership/) and
[contributing to the Spectrum Defense Fund](http://www.arrl.org/spectrum-defense-fund);
in the United States ARRL is the only voice of advocacy we have for our hobby.
