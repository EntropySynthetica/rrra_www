Kent KA0LDG discussed 
[Fox Hunting](https://www.everythinghamradio.com/2014/07/fox-hunting/)
(aka [transmitter hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter_hunting))
during the
[June club meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2019/june-meeting.md">}}) and
displayed some of the gear he uses during these activities:

* [Directional antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_antenna) with an [offset attenuator](https://nt1k.com/my-offset-attenuator-project/)
* Fox hunt transmitter

Plans for *home-brew* antennas suitable for Fox Hunting have been published in
various media, both print and on-line; prebuilt antennas are available from a
number of vendors.  Those wishing to build their own Fox Hunting antenna may
wish to use the design Joe Leggio WB2HOL in his
[Tape Measure Beam Optimized for Radio Direction Finding](http://theleggios.net/wb2hol/projects/rdf/tape_bm.htm)
article.

>This antenna evolved during my search for a beam with a really great

According to a simulation performed using
[YagiCAD \(4.1\)](https://www.yagicad.com/) WB2HOL's antenna has the
following characteristics:

Parameter | Measurement
---|---
Gain | 7.3 dBd
Front-to-Back Ratio | >50 db
3 db Beamwidth | E = 67.5 degrees
3 db Beamwidth | H = 110 degrees

WB2H0L's antenna uses a 1 inch wide steel tape-measure and other easy to
obtain materials. It can be easily constructed using common tools.

His 
[Tape Measure Beam Optimized for Radio Direction Finding](http://theleggios.net/wb2hol/projects/rdf/tape_bm.htm)
article discusses

* The design and various choices the builder can make during construction
* Construction
* Antenna performance including a plot of a measured sensitivity pattern

### About Fox Hunting Antennas 

The *nulls* provided by Fox Hunting antennas---unidirectional for Yagi-Uda and
bidirectional for Delta-Loops---are the feature that allows hunters to
determine the direction to a hidden transmitter.

Dave
[N1RF](https://www.qrz.com/db/N1RF/) indirectly demonstrates the Yagi-Uda null in his
[Yagi Antenna Teaching Construct Part #3: Directional Gain and Front to Back Ratio](https://www.n1fd.org/2016/11/08/yagi-antenna-3/) article on the
[Nashua Area Radio Society](https://www.n1fd.org/) website.

And there is a brief discussion of 
[Yagi Front-to-Back Ratio](http://www.arrl.org/forum/topics/view/118) in the
[ARRL General Technical Q & A forum](http://www.arrl.org/forum/categories/view/7).
