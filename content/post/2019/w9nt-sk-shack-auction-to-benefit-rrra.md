[Gurnee Bridgman, W9NT, became a Silent Key April 17, 2019](https://rrra.org/sk/w9nt/) ([obituary](http://silentkeyhq.com/main.php?p=bin/NSKALookup.php&dlnk=&call=W9NT&uid=0991555725179696)) and generously remembered RRRA in his will.

A silent auction to liquidate station equipment willed to RRRA will be
held immediately following the
[club's July business meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2019/july-meeting.md" >}})
16 July, 2019, at the
[West Fargo City Hall building]({{< relref "/places/west-fargo-city-hall.md" >}}),
800 4th Ave East, West Fargo, ND. The proceeds of this silent auction will
benefit RRRA.

Gurnee was an active ham and kept his station---for the most part---up
to date with modern equipment. The equipment offered for auction is
presentable, clean, and was in use up until Gurnee became a Silent Key;
however **no warranty is implied or offered**.
