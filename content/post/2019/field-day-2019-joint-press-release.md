### Volunteer Groups Train for Emergencies During National Amateur Radio Event

Members of the [Red River Radio Amateurs](https://rrra.org/)
will be participating in the national
[Amateur Radio Field Day](https://arrl.org/field-day)
exercise, June 22nd and 23rd, at the
[Cass County Highway Department Building, 1201 W Main Ave, West Fargo, ND]({{< relref "/calendar/2019/field-day.md" >}}).
Since 1933, ham radio operators across North America have established
temporary ham radio stations in public locations during Field Day to
showcase the science and skill of Amateur Radio. This event is open to
the public and all are encouraged to attend.

For more than 100 years, Amateur Radio---also called ham radio---has allowed
people from all walks of life to experiment with electronics and
communications techniques, as well as provide a free public service to their
communities during a disaster or emergency, all without needing a cell phone
or the Internet. Field Day demonstrates ham radio's ability to work reliably
under any conditions from almost any location and create an independent
communications network. More than 35,000 people from thousands of locations
participated last year in Field Day 2018 activities.

This year, The
[Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services \(EDS\) Team](https://salvationarmynorth.org/community/fargo/community-pages/disaster-services-team/)
will be supporting ham radio operators by providing water and meals
as a training opportunity. Amateur radio operators provide vital
communications to agencies such as The Salvation Army during times of
disaster.

*"It just seemed like a logical fit for our two groups to work and train
together"* said Andrew Lynch, Team Lead of The Salvation Army's EDS
Team. *"I personally am a ham radio operator, and have seen first-hand
how ham radio operators can assist our disaster operations. This is an
excellent chance for us to boost that relationship and get valuable
training from a planned event."*

Field Day operations begin at 1pm on Saturday, June 22nd and run through 1pm
on Sunday, June 23rd. A person does not have to be a ham radio licensee to
attend---this is a great chance to see what ham radio is all about and learn
how to get involved. More information can be found at https://rrra.org/
