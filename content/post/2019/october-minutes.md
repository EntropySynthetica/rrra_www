### Committee Reports 

#### Cass County (ND) ARES

Mark KK0V reported that another tutorial session on AREDN will be
held at the regular
[ARES meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2019/november-ares-meeting.md" >}})
before the
[November meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2019/november-meeting.md" >}}).
He also reported that the ID Badges from Cass County are on hold until
further notice. The MOU for the AREDN node on the Black Building was
discussed, it is progressing, albeit slowly.

#### Clay County (MN) ARES

Seth KC0ODE reported that the club pagers are now programmed with
incorrect parameters after a console changeout occurred at Dispatch. A
replacement solution was to be discussed under *New Business*.

#### Technical

Bob W0HNV reported that he didn't make it up to work on the Grandin
repeater due to weather and health issues. The committee assigned to
come up with a replacement for the Wheatland repeater was to meet after
the regular business meeting.

#### Education

Bob W0HNV reported that the General class was going well with about 4
regular attendees.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported that 15 examinees showed up to test at Hamfest and
reminded members that there will be a testing session next month after
the business meeting.

#### Hamfest

Mike NY0MN reported on the annual Hamfest held in September. Attendance
was down by about 103 people and net profit was $1364.43. A hamfest in
Cologne, MN was held the same weekend and likely caused the attendance
decline. He also reported that the fairgrounds is not available for
third weekend of September 2020; discussion was held on whether
alternate venues should be pursued to keep our standard third weekend in
September. The committee will explore other possible venues for 2020.

on the website. Steve can be contacted at webmaster@rrra.org
