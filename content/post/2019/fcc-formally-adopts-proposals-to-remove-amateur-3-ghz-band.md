On December 17, 2019, the ARRL website reported in an article titled
"[FCC Formally Adopts Proposals to Remove Amateur 3-GHz Band, Invites Comments](http://www.arrl.org/news/fcc-formally-adopts-proposals-to-remove-amateur-3-ghz-band-invites-comments)":

>At its December 12 meeting, the FCC formally adopted a Notice of
>Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in WT Docket 19-348 and invited comments
>on its plan to remove "existing non-federal secondary radiolocation
>and amateur allocations" in the 3.3 - 3.55 GHz band and relocate
>incumbent non-federal operations. The FCC said it's seeking comment
>on appropriate "transition mechanisms" to make that happen. ARRL has
>indicated that it will file comments in opposition to the proposal.[^1]

This action by the FCC signals their intent to proceed with
reallocation of frequency spectrum in compliance with the
[MOBILE NOW](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s19/text)
act which states "the Commission shall make available a total of at
least 255 megahertz of Federal and non-Federal spectrum below the
frequency of 6000 megahertz for mobile and fixed wireless broadband
use"[^2] and, in Sec. 5.3(a), specifically requires review of the
3.1--3.55 GHz band for reallocation.

<!--more-->

Reallocation of the 3.3--3.55 GHz band will impact RRRA's partially
deployed---and yet to be utilized---AREDN backbone by requiring the
replacement of equipment supporting several 3.4 GHz links. And it calls
into question the future viability of hobbyist experimentation and
investment in non-HF RF spectrum.

The ARRL article concludes with a quote from the
[AREDN Project](https://www.arednmesh.org/)
and some useful information for interested parties who wish to submit
comments pertaining to this matter.

>"The AREDN Project is able to leverage low-cost commercial devices
>solely because they are designed to operate on adjacent allocations"
>AREDN said on its website. "Moving to other allocations would be
>difficult if not impossible without a complete redesign, manufacture,
>purchase, and installation of new custom amateur hardware and
>software..., raising the price out of reach for the typical ham."

>Interested parties may file short comments on WT Docket 19-348 via the
>[FCC's Electronic Comment Filing Service \(Express\)](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filings/express).
>Visit the FCC
>[How to Comment on FCC Proceedings page](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/how-comment)
>for information on filing extended comments.[^3]

The FCC has clearly solicted comments pertaining **only** to
how Amateur Radio and other non-federal users will be moved
out of the 3.1--3.55 GHZ band. Anyone interested in commenting
on this NPRM is reminded that the Commission has a history of
ignoring public comments in deference to the forces of
[regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)
(e.g.  commercial interests).
