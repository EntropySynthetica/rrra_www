>Following the direction of the ARRL Board of Directors, ARRL has incorporated
>changes to the rules for all ARRL-sponsored contests and DXCC, prohibiting
>automated contacts. These changes also apply to the Worked All States
>(including Triple Play and 5-Band WAS), VHF/UHF Century Club, and Fred Fish,
>W5FF, Memorial awards. The changes are effective immediately.[^1]

>A resolution at the July ARRL Board of Directors meeting pointed to
>"growing concern over fully automated contacts being made and
>claimed" for contest and DXCC credit. The rules now require that each
>claimed contact include contemporaneous direct initiation by the operator on
>both sides of the contact. Initiation of a contact may be either local or
>remote.[^1]

A discussion of these rule changes by one of the authors of the motions;
N2RJ, an ARRL Director; was posted on Facebook and has been discussed in
forums such as the Minnesota Wireless Association mailing list :

>**What is allowed:**
>
>Operator initiated contacts on any digital mode. Operator initiated
>means that a human operator initiates a CQ call or answers a contact.
>Once the contact is completed, operator must initiate another if they
>so choose.
>
>Auto sequence is allowed - you initiate the contact, auto sequence sees
>it through, ends the contact. It is not allowed for any sort of
>automation to automatically start another contact.
>
>**What is NOT allowed:**
>
>Operator sets up fully automated QSOs that automatically answer and CQ
>again without human intervention. This is possible with external
>software to control WSJT-X, modified versions of WSJT-X and third party
>programs that use the WSJT decoding algorithms but offer fully
>automatic operation.
>
>**WHY we made this change:**
>
>Several members have contacted us saying that some stations are on the
>air 24x7 for months at a time. Joe Taylor himself expressed concern
>about this to me personally. So it was decided that we would address
>this.
>
>**What this affects:**
>
>All ARRL contests, ARRL awards starting with DXCC but other awards will
>have the rules adjusted.
>
>**What this does NOT affect:**
>
>Regular operation not claimed for DX or contest credit, such as WSPR
>beacons, Pactor/WinLink, Packet radio or AREDN.
>
>**Enforcement:**
>
>This is on the honor system primarily, but there are ways to determine
>unusual operation with modern technology. These fully automated
>contacts simply aren't allowed and repeated violation could result in
>harsher penalties including being barred from ARRL awards and
>contests".[^2]
