In episode 220 of the 
[Foundations of Amateur Radio](http://podcasts.itmaze.com.au/foundations/)
podcast,
[Onno VK6FLAB](https://qrz.com/db/VK6FLAB/),
discusses change in the ranks of our hobby.

>The hobby of amateur radio has been around for a long time. It was here before
>I was born and it will be here after I become a silent key. The same is true
>for you. While there is a recurring discussion about the death of the hobby,
>the reality is that our community changes continually. People come and go all
>the time. Reasons for change are as varied as the number of people you care to
>look at, from interest through to family, from money through to time, from
>boredom through to excitement, from life through to death.
>
>As our community fluctuates, our skill level varies. We see new people come
>into the hobby, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready for a new adventure, at
>the same time we have people who are experienced, or jaded, or both,
>participating in the community and finding themselves answering the same
>questions over and over again.
>
>The challenge in maintaining a semblance of community coherence is to balance
>the needs for new and aspiring amateurs with the expectations of those already
>in the community. How do you answer the same questions while staying fresh and
>encouraging, when all you really want to do is ignore the noise and get on
>with the hobby?
>
>The answer is simple ... [^1]
