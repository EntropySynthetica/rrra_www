Having the ability to experiment with operating your equipment in new
ways is an aspect of Amateur Radio which sets our hobby apart from
radio services such as
[CBRS](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/citizens-band-radio-service-cbrs),
[GMRS](https://www.fcc.gov/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs),
[FRS](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/family-radio-service-frs),
and [MURS](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/multi-use-radio-service-murs).

In his 
[Enjoy FT8 From Almost Anywhere](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/QST/This%20Month%20in%20QST/September2019/Witmer.pdf)
article ([a free preview from the August 2019 issue of QST Magazine)](http://www.arrl.org/this-month-in-qst),
J. Robert Witmer, W3RW, writes:

W3RW goes on to describe his approach to remote FT8 operation which
combines [WSJT-X](https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html)
and [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/) with his radio, shack
computer, and a mobile / portable device.

His article covers installation and configuration of WSJT-X and
TeamViewer at your station and of TeamViewer on your mobile / portable
device. 

W3RW then discusses:

* Single Band Operation
* Multiband Remote Operation
* Other Considerations

W3RW reminds Amateur Radio Operators to enable the "watch-dog timer"
in the *WSJT-X* software on their station computer to prevent run-away
operation. And to enable their transceiver's "watch-dog" feature if it
has one.

In closing, W3RW states:

>By combining *WSJT-X* FT8 operation with a remote desktop control
>program such as *TeamViewer* , you can add an exciting new dimension
>to operating. Operating remotely during breaks in the action while
>participating in other events can be a great way to catch elusive band
>openings and hopefully work a new one!
>
>If you're not a fan of FT8, the *TeamViewer* approach described
>here can be used to remotely control other station computer
>applications.[^1]
