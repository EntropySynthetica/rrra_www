The updated RRRAES Frequency list discussed by KD0IOE at the
[May 2019 ARES meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2019/may-ares-meeting.md" >}})
 has been published on-line. This list is
available as an Excel spreadsheet, PDF and CSV files.

The files are stored in the ***ARES | Documents and Manuals*** folder on
the [RRRA Groupware Server](https://cloud.rrra.org/).
This folder may be accessed without logging in through
a [public link](https://cloud.rrra.org/index.php/s/TO6r8rE6623qjBY)
(which is listed as *RRRA ARES Documents and Manuals* on the
[RRRA Files and Links page](/files/).)

Club members who need assistance with their Groupware Server account
should contact the {{< webmaster >}}.

### Important Information For CSV File Users

The CSV version of the RRRAES Frequency list is intended to be used with
"CHIRP" (a free open-source tool for programing your amateur radio).
Please visit the
[CHIRP homepage](https://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home)
or check your OS repositories, or store, to obtain this software.

A CHIRP Programming Webinar was presented October 20, 2016, by ARRL.
Please visit our
["Did you miss the ARRL CHIRP Programming Webinar?" blog post]({{< relref "/post/2016/did-you-miss-the-arrl-chirp-programming-seminar.md" >}})---published
November 9, 2016---to watch this webinar.

The safest way to use the CSV file in conjunction with CHIRP is to:

1. Download your radio's memory to the application
1. Save a backup copy of your radio's memory list
1. Merge in the RRRAES frequency list to your personal memory list. It
may be prudent to move your personal frequencies *out of the way of* the
RRRAES frequencies to preserve our standard channel numbering
1. Save a backup copy of the new memory list
1. Upload the new memory list to your radio
