Amateur Radio Operators engaged in mobile operation in the State
of Minnesota should consider carrying two documents to help defend
themselves in the event they are stopped for potentially violating the
[recently ammended Minnesota Statutes 2018, sections 169.011, subdivision 94; 169.475 *USE OF A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DEVICE*](https://legiscan.com/MN/bill/HF50/2019) 
(169.475); these amendments, enacted by HF50, are effective
August 1, 2019.

### Suggested Documents

* [Engrossed text of MN HF50 exempting amateur radio equipment from definition as a *wireless communications device* under 169.475](https://legiscan.com/MN/text/HF50/2019) ([local archive copy](https://cloud.rrra.org/index.php/s/zBnEw3oJdzwTlaA))
* FCC Amateur Radio License copy

While these documents may be useful in clarifying situations where Law
Enforcement personnel consider the **non-handsfree** use of amateur
radio equipment to be a violation of 169.475, they are not to be treated
as a *get out of jail free card*; courtesy and tact should govern all
interactions with Law Enforcement personnel.

### Printing your Amateur Radio License

On February 17, 2015, the FCC stopped routinely issuing paper license
documents to Amateur Radio applicants and licensees. While the FCC has
long considered the electronic records in their Universal Licensing
System ([ULS](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm)) to be the auctual official
Amateur Radio license authorizations, there are situations where an
offical paper copy of a license is needed.

This YouTube video succinctly demonstrates the process of downloading
official and reference copies of your Amateur Radio license. You
will need to know the password associated with your FRN to download the
official copy.

Although it is *"easier"* to download the reference copy of an Amateur
Radio license, these reference copies include a prominent notice stating
they are not an official FCC license; this notice ***may*** be an issue in
certain circumstances.
