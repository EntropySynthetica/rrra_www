### About SKYWARN Recognition Day
{{< figure src="/images/skywarn-recognition-day.png" >}}
<p class="clear"></p>

>SKYWARN&trade; Recognition Day was developed in 1999 by the National Weather
>Service and the American Radio Relay League. It celebrates the contributions
>that SKYWARN volunteers make to the NWS mission, the protection of life and
>property. Amateur radio operators comprise a large percentage of the SKYWARN
>volunteers across the country. The Amateur radio operators also provide vital
>communication between the NWS and emergency management if normal
>communications become inoperative. During the SKYWARN Special Event operators
>will visit NWS offices and contact other radio operators across the
>world.[^1]

Event certificates will be [electronic and
printable](http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mtr/hamradio/certificate/certificate.php)
after the conclusion of SKYWARN Recognition Day.
