According to AMSAT-UK it doesn't take an elaborate rig to listen to the ISS:

>Almost any 144 MHz FM rig will receive the ISS, you can even use a general
>coverage VHF scanner with an external antenna. As far as the antenna is
>concerned the simpler the better. A 1/4 wave ground plane has a high angle
>of radiation and works well.[^1]
