### About The Ride

*The Flatlander! FM Rotary Ride* is the seventh annual cycling celebration
for all ages and all abilities and is one of featured events of Greater
Moorhead Days.

-->

This year's proceeds benefit the
[Rotary Ride Safe Program](http://fmrotaryfoundation.org/projects/rotary-ride-safe-program/)
which includes bike repair stations, bike racks, and bicycle safety
programs throughout the Fargo/Moorhead parks.

All ride routes start and end at Lindenwood Park Rotary Shelter near the
playground.
