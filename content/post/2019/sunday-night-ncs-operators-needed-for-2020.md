title = "Sunday Night NCS Operators Needed For 2020"

+++
Net Control Station (NCS) Operators are needed for the 2020 [Sunday Night
VHF/UHF nets](/dates/ncs-schedule/).

NCS operators call the net to order at its designated start time,
periodically call for participants to join, listen for check-ins, keep
track of the roster of stations for that particular net session, and
generally orchestrate the operation of the net.

Serving as an NCS operator is a great way to overcome *mic-fright*,
prepare for Public Service Communication events or deployments, and hone
your skills as a radio operator. Your service will be acknowledged on
the [RRRA NCS Operator Leader Board](/ncs/).

Our Net Coordinator, Jake K0RQ, will be putting the
2020 NCS roster together during November and December 2019.

Please contact {{< mailto K0RQ >}} if you have any questions or to
volunteer as an NCS for the 2020 season.

A [Net Preamble]({{< relref "/nets/preamble.md" >}}) (or script) is provided
to aid NCS operators in operating their nets.
