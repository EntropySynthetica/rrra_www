### Instructions

Before starting you will need know the webcal / iCalendar link for the calendar(s)
you're interested in. In most cases you will need to copy/paste this link as directed in the instructions for your calendering software.

Use this link for the complete RRRA calendar:<br>
<span class="genericon genericon-month" style=font-size:1.5em;padding-right:.4em></span><a href="webcal://rrra.org/calendar/index.ics">webcal://rrra.org/calendar/index.ics</a>

Other webcal / iCalendar links may be found through the ***Dates*** links in
the sidebar of any page on this website.

Then choose the instructions for your calendering software ...

#### Apple iCalendar

Click the webcal / iCalendar link for the calendar you're interested in (e.g.
[webcal://rrra.org/calendar/index.ics](webcal://rrra.org/calendar/index.ics))
and it will be added to iCalendar on all devices associated with your
Apple ID.

Follow the instructions in the
[How to Subscribe to Calendars on Mac](https://www.howtogeek.com/409359/how-to-subscribe-to-calendars-on-mac/)
How-To Geek blog post if the webcal subscription link does not work on
