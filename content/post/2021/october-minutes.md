## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports 

#### ARES

Seth KC0ODE reported there were a total of 75 ARES participants last
month, total of ARES nets 5, total exercises 4, total of 31 hours. One
community event for 40 hours. RRRA has consolidated Cass and Clay ARES
into a single RRRA ARES to better match ICS. RRRA Hamfest was the same
day as the Fargo Marathon, so the marathon was short volunteers, but
proceeded with a few staffing adjustments. All positions were covered.

#### Technical

Kirk W0HNV was not present. Jake K0RQ and Andy KD0IOE went up to MSUM
to investigate the VHF issues with the W0ILO repeater and could not
duplicate the problem, but did notice issues with the power supply. They
swapped it with the left-over power supply from the Wheatland repeater.
Users are encouraged to try the VHF side of the repeater and report
any problems to Jake, Andy, or Kirk. Jim N0TSZ noted there was a past
issue at the MSUM site related to the grounding of the HVAC system; it's
possible the grounding has been disrupted.

#### Education

Jay WS0Y is working on making the Technician class content available
on-demand online. Prospective hams can then go through the material on
their own time and schedule a test with the VE Team.

#### Hamfest

Pete WC0G reported the Hamfest was successful. Attendance was lighter
than normal due to two other hamfests on the same day, and the Canadian
border still being closed. Roughly 160-170 people attended. Ledger from
the Hamfest is included in the Treasurer's Report. Pete has indicated he
will not have time to organize next year's Hamfest, so someone else will
need to take over. Hamfest next year is September 24^th^, 2022. Pete
will follow up with the fairgrounds and see if the club's contract is
through 2022 or 2023.

#### VE

Pete WC0G reported only 5 people tested at the Hamfest It was the first.

of demand for testing as of late                                       .

#### Media

Steve K0STK's report is available on the cloud website. Steve
extensively documents all upgrades and improvements he is making to
the club's online infrastructure. Any questions about the website or
listserver please contact webmaster@rrra.org.

### Old Business

#### Dues Increase Motion

Steve K0STK tabled his previous motion until next month. He emphasized
the need for members to step-up and volunteer for the club's activities.
Jim N0STZ noted that increasing the dues to the proposed amount would
significantly hinder the amount of club members. Motion was tabled.

#### Fargo Marathon

Andy KD0IOE reported the marathon went well. It was relatively quiet
and uneventful, which is what the organizers hoped for. The group was
five volunteers short, but some shuffling of volunteers was done to
accommodate. Having the Hamfest and Fargo Marathon on the same day
was inconvenient and should be avoided in the future. Using the W0ILO
repeater for the marathon and W0RRW repeater for Hamfest talk-in worked
very well. The Fargo Marathon is going through some internal changes, so
the future of the marathon is uncertain. No date has been set for 2022.

### New Business

#### Zoom Renewal

Lori KC0GQE requested \$155 to renew the club's Zoom account. Mark
KC0SHM moved, Pete WC0G seconded. Motion carried unanimously.

#### I Am Responding

Seth KC0ODE moved to renew I Am Responding for \$350. Brad KE0LDS
seconded. Motion carried unanimously.

#### Club Donations

Jim N0TSZ brought up a concern regarding donations and the value being
declared on donation receipts. Lori KC0GQE has a donation receipt form
already.

* Motion to modify the form to remove the portion declaring value by Steve K0STK
* Seconded by Brad KE0LDS
*  Motion carried unanimously

### Good of the Order

* The club received a Thank You card from Dale WD0AKO for the flowers
that were sent for his daughter's funeral
* Steve K0STK prepared a video tutorial on renewing Amateur Radio
licenses online and presented it

* Jason ND0JL from Jamestown brought his retired Ambulance that is he
turning to a mobile ham shack to the meeting for attendees to check out
afterwards

### Adjournment

* Motion to adjourn by Mark KC0SHM
* Seconded by Seth KC0ODE
* Meeting adjourned at 19:59
