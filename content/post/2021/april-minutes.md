## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports 

#### Cass County ARES

Mark KK0V reported the link to the virtual Skywarn training is on the
club website. There is a Great Lakes Area Winlink net and is open to
all licensed operators. The net is on Wednesdays. Anyone with questions
regarding ARES ID badges reach out to Mark. It does appear the FCC has
left a portion of the 3.5 GHz band for amateur use, which should help
AREDN. The goal is to complete some AREDN upgrades this summer while the
weather is nice.

#### Clay ARES

Seth KC0ODE was not present. Jarod W0JPJ reported that Cass and Clay
Counties are testing upgrades for Cass-Clay Alerts. There were also some
pager outages that have been fixed.

#### Technical

 Kirk W0HNV reported the Grandin repeater has failed on the bench again.
 It might be a compatibility issue with the repeater and the controller.
 Jake K0RQ brought up getting a Yaesu repeater since they are currently
 on discount from Yaesu. Jarod W0JPJ advised against it as he has had
 trouble with his, and suggested we get something commercial grade. Ken
 W0CZ moved to relocate the old Wheatland repeater and retune it to the
 Grandin frequency. Don KC0DCF seconded. Motion carried. Brian K0EED
 confirmed the Barnesville repeater is still hotlinked to Fisher and
 can still reach the Grand Forks National Weather Service office for
 Skywarn. Jarod W0JPJ is still looking into the old Clay County Landfill
 site for a potential repeater.

#### Education

 Kirk W0HNV reported there are no classes scheduled for the immediate
 future. Classes will start back up when deemed safe. Jay WS0Y added
 that there are still lots of new licenses being issued despite no
 in-person classes or testing.

### Hamfest

Pete WC0G reported there was a meeting last week. They are still in the
early planning stages. Anyone wanting to volunteer please contact Pete.
The Hamfest is still scheduled for September. Kent KA0LDG encouraged
everyone think of door prizes to give out at the hamfest.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported the last test session had five candidates. A test
session is being planned for next month, date TBD. If there is not an
RRRA session scheduled or our date does not work, the Maple Grove Club
is welcoming RRRA members that would like to test.

#### Media

are always uploaded in plain text to the website and in word processor
form on the cloud website. Any questions about the website or listserver
