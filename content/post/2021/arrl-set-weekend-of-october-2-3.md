>The weekend of October 2--3 is designated for holding the annual
>ARRL Simulated Emergency Test (SET), although local and Section-level

>national emergency exercise and is designed to assess the skills and
>preparedness of Amateur Radio Emergency Service&reg; (ARES&reg;)
>volunteers, as well as those affiliated with other organizations
>involved in emergency and disaster response.
<!--more-->

>The SET encourages maximum participation by all radio amateurs,
>partner organizations, and national, state, and local officials who
>typically engage in emergency or disaster response. In addition to ARES
>volunteers, those active in the National Traffic System (NTS), Radio
>Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES), National Weather Service (NWS)
>SKYWARN&copy;, Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), and a variety
>of other allied groups and public service-oriented radio amateurs are
>needed to fulfill important roles in this nationwide exercise.
>
>The SET offers volunteers an opportunity to test equipment, modes, and
>skills under simulated emergency conditions and scenarios. Individuals
>can use the time to update a "go-kit" for use during deployments and to
>ensure their home station's operational capability in an emergency or
>disaster. To get involved, contact your local
>[ARRL Emergency Coordinator](mailto:ares@rrra.org) or
