The last day of the 2020--2021 Isolation Net will be Friday, March 28th. 

I'd like to thank each and every one of the participants of the Isolation Net
for checking in during these last 14 plus months.

I thought the net would be a good idea for us to get together and chat with
someone other than those at home while we isolate from the pandemic. 

COVID-19 is an alarming disease that touched everyone around the globe in some
form. I'm sure we all know someone who got it and some of us know someone who
died from it. 

Throughout our time on the net Amateur Radio kept us in touch with each other
and, in my opinion, helped us get through these crazy times. I hope you
enjoyed the net and found it worthwhile. 

We might bring the net back when summer is over; we'll take a look when that
time comes to see if there is a need. Remember, the last day of the Isolation
Net will be this Friday, May 28th.
