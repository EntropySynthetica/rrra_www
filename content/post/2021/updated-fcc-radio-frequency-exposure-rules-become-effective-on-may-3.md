[Two years ago](https://rrra.org/cal/2019/04/16/april-club-meeting/)
KA0LDG made a presentation titled *RF Exposure Evaluation for
Amateur Radio Operators* (PDF and Powerpoint versions are available in the
**Training and Education | Presentations** folder on the [RRRA Groupware
server](https://cloud.rrra.org/)) in anticipation of the updated FCC RF
exposure rules.

This week ARRL reports in 
[ARRL General Bulletin ARLB011 \(2021\)](http://www.arrl.org/w1aw-bulletins-archive/ARLB011/2021)
and the
[Updated Radio Frequency Exposure Rules Become Effective on May
3](http://www.arrl.org/news/updated-radio-frequency-exposure-rules-become-effective-on-may-3)
News story:

>The FCC has announced that rule changes detailed in a lengthy 2019 Report and
>Order governing RF exposure standards go into effect on May 3, 2021. The new
>rules do not change existing RF exposure (RFE) limits but do require that
>stations in all services, including amateur radio, be evaluated against
>existing limits, unless they are exempted. For stations already in place,
>that evaluation must be completed by May 3, 2023. After May 3 of this year,
>any new station, or any existing station modified in a way that's
>likely to change its RFE profile---such as different antenna or
>placement or greater power---will need to conduct an evaluation by the
>date of activation or change. [^1]

According to Greg Lapin, N9GL, chair of the ARRL RF Safety Committee and a
member of the FCC Technological Advisory Council (TAC):

>"For amateurs, the major difference is the removal of the categorical
>exclusion ... which means that every ham will be required
>to perform some sort of calculation, either to determine if they
>qualify for an exemption or must perform a full-fledged exposure
>assessment. For hams who previously performed exposure assessments on
>their stations, there is nothing more to do." [^2]

Amateur Radio operators---especially those who have never conducted an RF
exposure evaluation of their station---are encouraged to review the ARRL News
