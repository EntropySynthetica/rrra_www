## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports 

#### Cass County ARES

Mark KK0V reported there should not be a flood activation this Spring
based on the current flood forecast. Anyone that has not yet received an
updated ARES badge should fill out the form on the cloud website to get
one. Mark will start organizing the trailer in the coming weeks once it
warms up. The trailer will need new batteries. Also discussed was the
idea of using 10m or 6m as a means of supplementing AREDN.

#### Clay ARES

Seth KC0ODE was not present. Jarod W0JPJ reported he looked at the radio
equipment that Clay County wanted to donate but determined most of it
was not worth the club's time. Clay County has a vacant tower near the
landfill they would not be opposed to the club installing equipment on.
He also noted that Fargo and Cass County are migrating to Minnesota's
ARMER system in the coming weeks.

#### Technical

Kirk W0HNV reported that he has been using the Grandin repeater on his
bench and it appears to be working well. He is still waiting on a good
weather window to get it installed at the Grandin site.

#### Education

Kirk W0HNV reported there are not any plans to start classes at this
time. The West Fargo Library is open, but the rooms are not available
yet. Hopefully by Fall classes can startup again.

### Hamfest

Pete WC0G reported there was a meeting three weeks ago to begin the
planning process. Another meeting will be scheduled in the next few
weeks. The group is still proceeding as normal for a September Hamfest.
KA0LDG added they would like everyone to find prize donations.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported the first virtual test session took place February
25<sup>th</sup>. The next session is scheduled for Thursday April
1<sup>st</sup>. Anyone wanting to register can find the session on
HamStudy.org. There will be 5 test slots available. Only one person can
test at a time unless more VE's volunteer to help.

#### Media

Steve K0STK's report is available on the cloud website. Meeting minutes
are always uploaded in plain text to the website and in word processor
form on the cloud website. According to the latest Google search
statistics, 38% of visitors are on a mobile device. All club members
should have an account on the cloud website. Any questions about the
website or listserver please contact webmaster@rrra.org.

out to Jarod W0JPJ.

to donate to the club. Anyone interested in helping sort through the
contents should contact Jarod

Service). Once trained in, it is a minimal commitment each month
