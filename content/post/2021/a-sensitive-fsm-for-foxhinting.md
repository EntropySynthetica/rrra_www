article ([a free preview from the July 2021 issue of QST Magazine)](http://www.arrl.org/this-month-in-qst),
Woody White, KZ4AK, presents the Field Strength Meter (FSM) for Foxhunting he
built based on a design featured in the June 2001 QST article *Simple
RF-Power Measurement* by Les Hayward, W7ZOI, and Bob Larking, W7PUA.

KZ4AK begins with a brief discussion of the W7ZOI/W7PUA digital readout
FSM he built. And he quickly arrives at a key design consideration
relevant to Foxhunting: "... signal trends are harder to follow on
digital readouts than with an analog meter." [^1]

His article covers:

* Why a sensitive wide dynamic range FSM is a useful Foxhunting tool
* Considerations related to the meter's lack of selectivity
* Circuit simplifications for Foxhunting and construction style

KZ4AK's article references two QST articles about similar FSMs and
includes the complete schemetic diagram for his FSM.
