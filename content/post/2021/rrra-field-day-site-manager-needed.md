RRRA needs an Infrastructure Manager---or Management Team---for the club's
[2021 Field Day Site]({{< relref "/calendar/2021/field-day.md">}}) June
26--27 at the
[Cass County Highway Department]({{< relref "/places/cass-county-highway-department.md" >}})
in West Fargo.

The Field Site Infrastructure Manager is responsible for:

* Signing for and securing the keys to the Field Day site gates and bathrooms
* Getting the 6000 pound RRRA communications trailer towed to to the Field Day
site and assisting with set-up. This trailer has a tongue weight of 600
pounds and requires an appropriately equipped tow vehicle

This year's Site Infrastructure Manager(s) should contact {{< mailto KK0V >}} as soon as
possible so that he can arrange for access to the keys and so that he
has time to prepare the trailer for deployment.

**RRRA will not be able to operate a 2021 Field Day Site if no one is willing to
undertake these responsibilities.**
