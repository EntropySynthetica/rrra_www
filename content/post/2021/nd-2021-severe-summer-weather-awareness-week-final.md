### Severe Thunderstorms [^1]

A Severe Thunderstorm is defined as a thunderstorm capable of producing:

* Wind gusts of 58 mph or greater and / or
* Hail of one inch in diameter or greater

In addition to damaging winds and large hail, severe thunderstorms are also
capable of producing tornados, flash flooding and deadly lightning.

<p class="clear"></p>

Stay away from windows! Flying debris and wind driven hail can break
windows sending shards of glass through the air.

If camping, seek shelter inside a sturdy building as campers/RVs can be
easily flipped by damaging winds associated with severe thunderstorms.
Falling trees and large hail can easily penetrate the thin walls of a
tent.

Those in mobile homes should go to their designated storm shelter.
Destructive straight-line winds are capable of causing significant
damage to mobile homes.

Severe thunderstorms are capable of producing tornadoes with little
warning. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your favorite media outlet
for frequent weather updates.

#### Tornado Safety Tips

If in a building, go to the basement if one is available. Get under the
stairs or a piece of sturdy furniture. If there is no basement, get to the
centermost room on the lowest level, putting as many walls as possible between
you and the outside. Protect your head, neck and spine.

Stay away from windows! Avoid seeking shelter in gymnasiums or large
auditoriums.

If in a mobile home, seek a storm shelter or a nearby permanent building.
Have a plan! 40% of tornado deaths occur in mobile homes.

If you are outside and cannot get inside a sturdy structure, lay down in a
ditch or low lying area (beware of possible flooding).

When driving, if a tornado is spotted in the distance, stay calm and drive
away from it. However, in heavy traffic, never try to outrun a tornado. Seek
shelter in a sturdy building. If no building is available, lay down in a ditch
or low lying area.

The tornado drill is a great time to:

* Review your severe weather plan of where to take shelter at home, work or at school
* Practice going to your shelter area
* Ensure you have multiple ways of receiving a warning. Don't just rely on the siren!

#### Don't just rely on the Tornado Siren!

<p class="clear"></p>
{{< figure src="https://www.weather.gov/images/bis/Siren.png" link="https://www.weather.gov/images/bis/Siren.png" >}}
<p class="clear"></p>

Outdoor warning sirens are designed to warn those outside of threatening
weather or some other type of emergency. You may or may not be able to
hear a siren from within your home, especially when you are sleeping.
Also, sirens may become disabled by severe weather.

Sirens are activated primarily by city or county officials. Each city
or county can establish its own guidelines for when to activate the
siren, such as for severe thunderstorm warnings in addition to tornado
warnings. Contact or visit the website of your city or county emergency
management for outdoor siren policy.

#### Get Indoors!

On average there are 47 deaths each year in the United States resulting from
lightning strikes. If you are outside and can hear thunder, you are in danger
of being struck!

Lightning can strike as far as 15 miles from any rain falling with the
thunderstorm.
