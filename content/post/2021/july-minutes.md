Seth also did acquire some extra equipment from FM Ambulance. All the

a space where he can store it for the club.

#### Technical

having issues reprograming the replacement machine(s). There is also an
issue that has developed with the Moorhead VHF repeater on the receive
side, Kirk will be working to get the issue resolved.

#### Education

Kirk W0HNV reported he and Jay WS0Y are tentatively planning classes
starting in the fall. Classes no longer need to be completed before the
hamfest since VE testing can be done electronically/virtually. Brad
KE0LDS will not be doing any classes as of right now.

### Hamfest

Pete WC0G reported online sales for the hamfest have already begun.
There is a transaction fee of \$.52 per ticket that he has been paying
with the VE account.

* Motion to have the club reimburse the VE account for the transaction fees by Pete WC0G
* Seconded by Ken W0CZ
* Motion carried unanimously

Pete also indicated that volunteers will be needed for setup, teardown,
and during the hamfest. Two speakers have been lined up so far.

#### VEs

Pete WC0G reported he will arrange for online VE sessions for Kirk and
Jay's classes. VE testing during the hamfest will be online as well,
candidates must register in advance, no walkups. The RRRA VE team will
also be handing the Maple Grove club's VE sessions this week. Every
other month testing will also start back up if there is interest.

#### Media

Steve K0STK was not present. His report is available on the cloud
website. New members should reach out to Steve to get setup for the

### Old Business

#### Field Day

and made over 500 contacts. There were 14 visitors that signed the log.
The group in Sabin also had a good turnout.

#### AREDN Committee

See Cass ARES report.

### New Business

#### Fargo Marathon

Andy KD0IOE brought up the Fargo Marathon is September 25<sup>th</sup>,
the same day as the hamfest. The marathon intends on operating the same
way they always do. This creates a conflict with both volunteers and
repeater use. Options are using the W0RRW repeater or trying out the
repeater in the trailer and locating it centrally on the route. Around
20 volunteers will be needed for the marathon. Anyone interested in
helping should contact Andy.

#### Club Credit/Debit Card

Jarod W0JPJ wanted to get a club debit card setup. Since he was not
present this item was tabled.

#### Storage Unit Rental

Lori KC0GQE received a bill for the storage unit for \$959.40 that
will be due later this fall. Mark KC0SHM moved to approve, Kent KA0LDG
seconded. Motion carried unanimously.

#### Christmas Party

Lori KC0GQE will book the Pizza Ranch for 45<sup>th</sup> Street for a
Christmas Party in December.

#### Fargo Police Picnic

### Good of the Order

* Kirk W0JPJ noted that if even half of the club's 69 members
volunteered to help, there would be more than enough volunteers for the
hamfest and the marathon. This is the club's largest fundraiser for the
year. Lori encouraged everyone to see if family members would be willing
to help.

### Adjournment

* Motion to adjourn by Kent KA0LDG
* Seconded by Steve K0OP
* Meeting adjourned at 19:54
