In their announcement published in the SKCC
[March 2021 Rag Chew](https://www.skccgroup.com/member_services/newsletter/issues/202103_Rag_Chew.pdf)
newsletter, the Expedition organizers state:

>We will try to keep operating as much as possible and may even do a bit
of FT8 for those needing ND. Keep an eye out on the
[[SKCC Sked page](https://sked.skccgroup.com/)]
as we begin our operation. [^1]

DXpedtion operators will primarily use the call K8AQM/0 to
provide that much needed ND ***S*** contact for those working on their
[SKCC WAS-S award](https://www.skccgroup.com/operating_awards/was-s/).

The Expedition organizers hope the operation will include radio
operators from the Fargo area and Red River Radio Amateurs club.
