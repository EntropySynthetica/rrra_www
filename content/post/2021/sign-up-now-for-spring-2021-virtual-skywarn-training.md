#### What is SKYWARN?

Skywarn (formed in the early 1970s) is the National Weather Service
(NWS) program of volunteer severe weather spotters. Skywarn volunteers
support their local community and government by providing the NWS
with timely and accurate severe weather reports. These reports, when
integrated with modern NWS technology, are used to inform communities
of approaching severe weather. The focus of Skywarn (and of the NWS) is
simple...to save lives and property.

Since the mid 1990s, the WSR-88D (Doppler Weather Radar) has provided
valuable information to area forecasters...with better detection of
severe storm phenomena and more accurate and timely warnings. However,
even with the advance in technology... "ground truth" is still a very
important part of the warning process. "Ground truth" is what is
actually occurring. Is the storm tornadic? Is it producing large hail?
How about damaging winds? Most of the "ground truth" is provided by
trained storm spotters (through Skywarn)...or the "eyes of the NWS."

#### Who Are SKYWARN Severe Weather Spotters?

SKYWARN spotters across North Dakota and Minnesota consist mainly of
amateur radio operators, emergency response officials, and trained
public responders. The vast majority of those involved are volunteers
who provide this valuable public service. These Spotters donate their
time and equipment to help us (the NWS) get warnings out to the public,
and to get public reports of severe weather back to the NWS ...by any
means possible.

Spotters are generally self-activating... meaning they pay attention
to the latest Forecast, Convective Outlook, and Watch or Warning...
then they observe and report on the occurrence of severe weather from
wherever they may be located.

#### How can I get involved?

Every year the National Weather Service in Grand Forks conducts both
"basic" and "advanced" spotter training classes. Individuals are
taught the basics of thunderstorm development, storm structure, what
constitutes severe weather, and how to report this information. Advanced
classes consider more extreme storm features to look for and where to
find them. Additional information on reporting and basic severe weather
safety are also covered.

Each class, Basic and Advanced, is a multi-media presentation which
includes detailed video. Classes are typically scheduled back-to-back
on the same evening. Each class typically takes around 70 minutes, with
about a 15 minute break for questions and refreshments. New Spotters are
encouraged to attend the Basic Class while veteran Spotters may chose to
attend the Advanced Class.
