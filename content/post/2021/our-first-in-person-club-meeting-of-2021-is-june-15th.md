The [RRRA Board of Directors]({{< relref "/about/contact/_index.md#board-of-directors" >}})
is pleased to announce the club's return to *in-person* meetings with the
[7PM June 15th, 2021, Business Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2021/june-meeting.md" >}})
at West Fargo City Hall.

A Zoom link to our meeting room is *planned* for those members who are unable
to---or do not wish to---attend an in-person meeting at this time. The
[RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra)
will be used to distribute a Zoom invitation for those members who wish to participate virtually.

Members who are fully vaccinated (i.e. have completed their course of
vaccinations at least 2 weeks ago) are welcome to attend our meeting without
wearing a face covering. But they should pay attention to official signage
posted in an around City Hall for potential changes to local policy.

Members who are **not** fully vaccinated should follow
[CDC Guidance for unvaccinated people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)---including
wearing a face covering---if they choose to attend our meeting. They
should keep in mind that the CDC considers attending a small, indoor gathering
of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people from multiple households to be a
***Less Safe*** activity.  And attending a full-capacity worship service to be
a ***Least Safe*** activity. 

Members who have a weakened immune system, or who have been recently exposed to
COVID-19, should consider attending our meeting through the Zoom link.
