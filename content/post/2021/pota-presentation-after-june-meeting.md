Do you like [Field Day](https://arrl.org/field-day)?
Do you like to operate from remote locations?

I'll be giving a
[Parks on the Air \(POTA\)](https://parksontheair.com/)
presentation after the
[July 20th RRRA business meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2021/july-meeting.md"
>}}).
<!--more-->

This presentation may be postponed if the business meeting runs long.

### About Parks on the Air

>Parks on the Air (POTA) was founded Sept. 15, 2010, to encourage
>amateur-radio operators who enjoy the outdoors -- but who may not be
>interested in or able to take long hikes or make steep climbs -- to blend
>their interests by operating from municipal, county, state, provincial, and
>national parks around the world. [^1]

POTA has since grown into a program "for international portable amateur radio
operations that promote emergency awareness and communications from
national/federal and state/provincial level parks." [^2]
