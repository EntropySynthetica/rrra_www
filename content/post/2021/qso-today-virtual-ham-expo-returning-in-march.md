### About QSO Today

>QSO Today is a podcast about the international hobby of amateur radio
>also known as ham radio. Every week, [Eric WA6IGR interviews] a "ham"
>to hear their ham radio story and what they are doing now. Many of
>the technologies that we enjoy today including television and radio,
>cell phones, computers, and the Internet were born out amateur radio
>hobbyists experimenting with electronics and radio in their basements
>and garages. Amateur radio was and still is the frontier where hams
>conducted electronic experiments in order to make that wireless contact
>around the World.
>
>As a kid growing up in Southern California during the 60s, amateur radio was
>WA6IGR's ticket to electronics, science, and technology.  Its hams were [his] mentors.
>These interviews allow [WA6IGR] to share the ham radio stories to inspire you to
>join this amazing hobby, or if you are already here, to grow and learn more
>from these stories. [^2]
