It's time to start planning for the
[2021 ARRL Dakota Division Convention and RRRA Hamfest]({{< relref "/calendar/2021/rrra-hamfest.md" >}}).
This is the largest Hamfest in North Dakota drawing
attendees from 3 states and 1 Canadian province. Committee members
are needed to plan and run this major fund raising activity for our
club. Lots of volunteers will make the work easy for everyone.

Planning will be conducted using the Zoom teleconferencing service
until in-person meeting restrictions are lifted.

Hamfest Committee volunteers are asked to
[subscribe to the hamfest mailing list]({{< relref "/post/2021/hamfest-committee-members-needed.md#subscribing-to-the-mailing-list" >}})
so that they can stay informed and be a part of the conversation.
Volunteers may subscribe multiple
addresses (e.g. work and mobile e-mail) if desired.

A shared folder is available to committee
members at the <a href="https://cloud.rrra.org" rel="nofollow">RRRA
Groupware Server</a> for document sharing and archiving.

Please contact {{< mailto WC0G >}} if you have any questions about this
event.
