Participation in our weekly UHF/VHF Net has sharply dwindled during the
last few months and it is now time to choose a future course for the
net.

***You*** can help with this process by taking the
[2021 RRRA Net Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/7Z2CSPD).

All RRRA Members are encouraged to participate in this survey regardless of
whether or not they are a regular net participants.

Your comments will help help us learn where we need to improve---or make
changes to---the net. Our goal is to get as many hams as possible to
check-in to our net.

RRRA Members are also encouraged to attend the club's upcoming
[Business Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2021/september-meeting.md" >}})
on September 21st for discussion of the results of the 2021 RRRA Net
Survey.
