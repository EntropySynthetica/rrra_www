>is looking for ham radio operators to make recordings of time-standard
>stations during the June 2021 annular solar eclipse across the Arctic Circle
>as part of a citizen science experiment. Researchers will use the
>crowd-sourced data to investigate the superimposed effects of auroral
>particle precipitation and the eclipse on HF Doppler shift.

<!--more-->

>Participants would collect data using an HF radio connected to a
>computer running open-source software. A precision frequency standard,
>such as a GPS-disciplined oscillator, is desired but not required to
>participate. Radio amateurs and shortwave listeners around the globe
>are invited to take part, even stations far from the path of totality.
>
>Last year's eclipse festivals included more than 100 participants from
>45 countries. The experiment will run June 7--12. All participants will
>receive QSL certificates and updates as the data is processed. This is
>a pilot experiment for HamSCIs Personal Space Weather Station project,
>which seeks to develop a global network monitoring the geospace
>environment. For more information and set-up instructions, visit the
>[June 2021 Arctic Eclipse Festival](https://hamsci.org/june-2021-eclipse-festival-frequency-measurement)
