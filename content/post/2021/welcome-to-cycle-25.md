article ([a free preview from the April 2021 issue of QST Magazine)](http://www.arrl.org/this-month-in-qst),
Steve Ford, WB8IMY, discusses the new solar cycle that is under way and how it
is having a positive effect on HF band conditions.

<!--more-->

WB8IMY begins with some background information on solar cycles and discusses
discovery of harbingers of the next solar cycle.

His article covers:

* Differing predictions for Cycle 25
* Changes in HF band behavior
* Benefits for low-power operating and mobiles
* Tips for preparing for the cycle peak 

A *2021 Propagation Forcast* sidebar by Carl Luetzelschwab,
K9LA---originally published in the January/February 2021 Issue of
NCJ---discusses the question "How big will Cycle 25 be?"

In closing, WB8IMY writes:

>Better days are on the way---we just don't know by how much. All hams
>will benefit regardless of license class. Who knows? History may repeat
>itself and Cycle 25 could even rival Cycle 19.[^1]
