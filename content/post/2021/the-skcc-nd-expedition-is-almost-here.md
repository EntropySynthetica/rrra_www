Time is moving fast; in less than a week the North Dakota Expedition
will be on the air. Presently we have four operators and five stations
to set up.
<!--more-->

The four operators (but several more possible) include:

* K8AQM/0, Ted #1629s
* K8JAD/0, Jeremy #1307t
* K0CRF, Tim #9367
* W0EJ, Bill #10440s

Although this is an SKCC expedition, we will try to have one station
running on FT8 for those needing a cw break and an FT8 fix.

We have antennas for 160, 80, 40, 30 20, 17 and 15m; there are three
amps and 300-400 watts each available *if needed*. We most likely will
not have internet for the sked page as we are "in the country" (which
means very low noise!) so please spot and pass the word where we can
be found.

If a paper QSL is your desire please QSL using the
[SKCC bureau]({{< relref "/post/2021/be-a-part-of-the-2021-ndxpedition.md#qsl-policy" >}}).
**All** bureau cards will be quickly responded to and we're trying to
introduce the "free" SKCC QSL bureau to the membership so check out how
to use the QSL bureau on the SKCC home web page.

Help us fill our logs and fill your need for North Dakota on as many
bands as possible.
