### Why FreeDV?

>Amateur Radio is transitioning from analog to digital, much as it transitioned
>from AM to SSB in the 1950's and 1960's. How would you feel if one or two
>companies owned the patents for SSB, then forced you to use their technology,
>made it illegal to experiment with or even understand the technology, and
>insisted you stay locked to it for the next 100 years? That's exactly what was
>happening with digital voice. But now, hams are in control of their technology
>again!
>
>FreeDV is unique as it uses 100% Open Source Software, including the speech
>codec. No secrets, nothing proprietary! FreeDV represents a path for 21st
>century Amateur Radio where Hams are free to experiment and innovate, rather
>than a future locked into a single manufacturers closed technology.
>
>Controlled testing suggests FreeDV is
>[comparable](https://www.rowetel.com/?p=7779) to and in some cases works
>better than SSB on low SNR channels.
>
>FreeDV 2020 is built around leading edge neural net speech coding
>([LPCNet](http://www.rowetel.com/?p=6639)),
>putting Ham radio at the forefront of digital radio innovation. It provides 8
>kHz wide audio bandwidth, while using just 1600 Hz of RF bandwidth.
>
>Urban HF noise is a growing problem for SSB communications. Hams around the
>world are using the advanced FEC and modem technology in FreeDV to overcome
>urban HF noise in channels where SSB is unusable.
>
>FreeDV 1600 and 2020 is being used over the
>[QO-100](http://www.rowetel.com/?p=6920)
>experimental combinations of [Internet and HF
>radio](http://www.rowetel.com/?p=6946) to overcome poor
>propogation. [^2]
