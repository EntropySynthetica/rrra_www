On August 20, 2022,
[KC0ODE announced cancellation of the September and October ARES meetings](https://lists.rrra.org/pipermail/announce/2022-August/000636.html)
along with plans for upcoming exercises.
<!--more-->

ARES members interested in
[Winlink Global Radio Email](https://winlink.org/)
are strongly encouraged to start adding that capability to their
station **now** in preparation for an upcoming exercise likely to
occur during Winter 2022--2023.

Linux and Macintosh users may wish to consider using the
[Pat cross platform Winlink client](https://getpat.io)
rather than struggling with
[windows-only software](https://downloads.winlink.org/User%20Programs/)
and
[Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_\(software\)).
