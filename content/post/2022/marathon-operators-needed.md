Spring will soon be here and so will the Fargo Marathon!

In partnership with local emergency responders, RRRA will once again be
providing the communications backbone for the Marathon aid stations.

Please see the
[Fargo Marathon 2022]({{< relref "/calendar/2022/fargo-marathon.md" >}})
page for the event schedule, equipment list, etc.

RRRA communications support for the Fargo Marathon will be coordinated
through the
[Marathon Mailing List](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/marathon).
All operators who wish to volunteer for this event must subscribe to the
Marathon Mailing List; even those who signed up on paper at a
club meeting or have previously contacted the Marathon Coordinator.
