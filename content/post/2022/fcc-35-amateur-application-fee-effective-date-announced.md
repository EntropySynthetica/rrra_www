ARRL's
[FCC Application Fee Instructions page](https://www.arrl.org/fcc-application-fee)
states that "VECs and Volunteer Examiner (VE) teams will **not** have to
collect the $35 fee at exam sessions." Applicants will pay the $35 fee
directly to the FCC through the
[CORES FRN Registration system](https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do);
successful exam candidates will receive an e-mail message from the FCC
containing payment instructions and will have **10 calendar days** from the
date of the e-mail to pay their application fee.
