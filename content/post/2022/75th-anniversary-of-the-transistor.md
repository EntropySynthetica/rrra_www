An important component used in our radios is 75 years old today!

On December 16, 1947,
[Walter Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Houser_Brattain) and
[John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen)---two
physicists who were members of
[Mervin Kelly's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Kelly)
Solid State Physics Group and Semiconductor Sub-Group at Bell Labs---managed to
make the first working transistor, now known as the
[point-contact transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor).

"A week after that, the device was officially demonstrated to Bell Labs
executives as a *magnificent Christmas present.* In January 1948, William
Shockley demonstrated the junction transistor. All three received The Nobel
Prize in Physics (1956)". [^1]

>The New York Herald Tribune predicted that this invention would be a
>revolution in the electronics industry. Little did they know just how big of
>a technology revolution this invention would end up being. The invention of
>the transistor may have been the greatest technology development of the 20th
>century!
>
>As the performance, reliability, and manufacturability of discrete
>transistors improved commercial products began to use transistors, including
>amplifiers, switches, and detector circuits. In 1954 the silicon
>bipolar-junction transistor (BJT), perfected by Gordon Teal of Texas
>Instruments Inc., brought the price of this discrete component down to $2.50.
>The Texas Instruments news release from May 10, 1954, read, "Electronic
>*brains* approaching the human brain in scope and reliability came much
>closer to reality today with the announcement by Texas Instruments
>Incorporated of the first commercial production of silicon transistors
>kernel-sized substitutes for vacuum tubes." Also in 1954 Bell Labs unveiled
>Tradic Phase One. The Tradic Phase One was the world's first fully
>transistorized computer containing 800 transistors instead of vacuum tubes.
>In March 1955 Sony began to sell its TR-52 transistor radio in the US for
>$29.95, soon capturing this market. It is no wonder that in 1956 John
>Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley received the Nobel Prize in
>Physics.

>Thanks to Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments
>and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor, the 1960's ushered in the
>era of Integrated Circuits (ICs). In the early 70's the crowning
>achievement was the ability to integrate thousands of transistors and
>resistors onto a silicon chip. One of the most important ICs was the
>microprocessor. Intel's 4004 microprocessor is widely regarded as the first
>commercial microprocessor. The 4004 was fabricated in 1971 with 2,250 Metal
>Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) transistors using 10 &micro;m PMOS technology. PMOS
>logic is a family of digital circuits based on p-channel
>metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). In
>the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the mid-70's PMOS circuits were
>superseded by Complimentary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)
>circuits. CMOS circuits use both p-channel and n-channel transistors. Today
>Apple's M1 chip has 16 billion transistors using TSMC's 5 nm
>FINFET CMOS technology node! [^2]

### About the Anniversary Celebration

>The
>[Electron Devices Society](https://eds.ieee.org/)
>has decided to celebrate the year
>2022-2023 as the
>[75th Anniversary of the Transistor](https://eds.ieee.org/about-eds/75th-anniversary-of-the-transistor).
>As the history of this invention and of its consequences is much more involved
>and interesting, it is imperative that the leading EDS Luminaries share the
>scientific & technological developments which took place in the last 75 years,
>with the current generation of researchers.  Popularizing talks at Conferences
>and Mini-Colloquia, Technical Articles in the EDS Newsletter, Webinar Series
>shall be a part of the various activities undertaken by [the] "75th
>Anniversary of the Transistor Adhoc Committee" with an aim to provide
>technical information and education to enlighten EDS members. This shall be a
>mark of tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the Transistor
>Story---Discovery, Development, and Applications which has had a lasting
>impact on people's lives and has benefited mankind where it serves good in
>social relations, caring for the Earth, science, technology, engineering, and
>economy. [^1]
