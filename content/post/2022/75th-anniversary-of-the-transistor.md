An important component used in our radios is 75 years old today!

On December 16, 1947,
[Walter Brattain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Houser_Brattain) and
[John Bardeen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bardeen)---two
physicists who were members of
[Mervin Kelly's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Kelly)
Solid State Physics Group and Semiconductor Sub-Group at Bell Labs---managed to
make the first working transistor, now known as the
[point-contact transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor).

"A week after that, the device was officially demonstrated to Bell Labs
executives as a *magnificent Christmas present.* In January 1948, William
Shockley demonstrated the junction transistor. All three received The Nobel
Prize in Physics (1956)". [^1]

### About the Anniversary Celebration

>The
>[Electron Devices Society](https://eds.ieee.org/)
>has decided to celebrate the year
>2022-2023 as the
>[75th Anniversary of the Transistor](https://eds.ieee.org/about-eds/75th-anniversary-of-the-transistor).
>As the history of this invention and of its consequences is much more involved
>and interesting, it is imperative that the leading EDS Luminaries share the
>scientific & technological developments which took place in the last 75 years,
>with the current generation of researchers.  Popularizing talks at Conferences
>and Mini-Colloquia, Technical Articles in the EDS Newsletter, Webinar Series
>shall be a part of the various activities undertaken by [the] "75th
>Anniversary of the Transistor Adhoc Committee" with an aim to provide
>technical information and education to enlighten EDS members. This shall be a
>mark of tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the Transistor
>Story---Discovery, Development, and Applications which has had a lasting
>impact on people's lives and has benefited mankind where it serves good in
>social relations, caring for the Earth, science, technology, engineering, and
>economy. [^1]
