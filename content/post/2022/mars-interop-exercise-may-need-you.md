On April 29, 2022, ARRL News reported about a MARS HF skills exercise during
early May 2022...

>Members of the Military Auxiliary Radio System (MARS) will conduct an HF
>skills exercise from Monday night, May 2 through Saturday, May 7, 2022 to
>practice interoperability with the amateur radio community.

<!--more-->

>A 60-meter high-power broadcast will begin on May 3 at 0200 UTC followed by
>the FEMA region net. That will continue four more nights at 0200 UTC with the
>region net. At 1200 local each day (May 3--7; Eastern, Central,
>Mountain, and Pacific) the net will be called by region.

>MARS members will be reaching out to the amateur radio community via the
>60-meters Channel 1 Net (5330.5 kHz). These are directed nets. The nets will
>be run by region. ***These are not typical "everyone check into the net"
>operations.*** Amateur ops who participate should listen first. Net control will
>ask for stations meeting specific criteria to check in, e.g., stations in a
>particular geographic area. Only stations that meet the criteria should check
>into the net.
>
>In addition to 60 meters, MARS stations will also reach out on amateur
>frequencies such as 80-meter traffic nets and other bands they may be able to
>reach. [^1]
