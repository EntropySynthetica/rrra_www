You'll probably never achieve coverage of, say, the entire US Eastern Seaboard or the Continental Divide in the lower 48. But with a couple of handhelds and the right Yagi antenna, you can access satellites in low Earth orbit that will provide you with a much wider "footprint" than just about any repeater."

In this episode of ARRL's monthly On The Air podcast: "Even if you're accessing a repeater, the range of your VHF/UHF handheld can be a bit constraining. You'll probably never achieve coverage of, say, the entire US Eastern Seaboard or the Continental Divide in the lower 48. But with a couple of handhelds and the right Yagi antenna, you can access satellites in low Earth orbit that will provide you with a much wider "footprint" than just about any repeater."[^1]
