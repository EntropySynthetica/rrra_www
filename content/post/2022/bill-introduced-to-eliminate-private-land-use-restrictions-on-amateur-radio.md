Days before the end of the current congressional session,
[Congressman Bill Johnson \(OH-6\)](https://billjohnson.house.gov/)
introduced a bill in the U.S.  House of Representatives
([H.R. 9670](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr9670))
to eliminate private land use restrictions that prohibit, restrict, or impair
the ability of an Amateur Radio Operator from operating and installing amateur
station antennas on property subject to the control of the Amateur Radio
Operator.

Unfortunately due to the timing of the introduction of this minor
piece of legislation there is little chance of its consideration
during the current congressional session.
