### About IARU

>The International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) is the worldwide federation
>of national amateur radio organizations. The membership of the IARU
>consists of more than 160 member-societies in as many countries and
>separate territories.
>
>The IARU was founded at a meeting in Paris in 1925 as the international
>representative of the Amateur Radio movement. At the time the "short
>waves" were just beginning to be understood and to be exploited for global
>communication using power levels and antennas that were within reach of
>private individuals operating from their own homes. These radio amateurs
>needed an organization to coordinate their activities and to be their
>voice at international conferences. [^3]
