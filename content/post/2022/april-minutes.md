## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports 

#### ARES

Seth KC0ODE reported there will be Skywarn Training on Monday 4/25
from 6:30p-9p at the Sabin Fire Hall, Thursday 5/12 from 6:30p-9p at
the Fargo Public Safety Building, and Tuesday 5/24 from 6:30p-9p at
the Red River Regional Marksmanship Center 6:30p-9p. There will also
be training on Monday 5/9 at the Moorhead Law Enforcement Center from
2p-4p. Training is also available virtually every Friday through the end
of May from 2p-3:30p. Virtual Training does require registration through
the National Weather Service. Seth plans to break into Sunday Night Net
for simulated emergency simplex net at some point to practice passing
messages and signal reports. That will be conducted on 147.520 MHz.

#### Technical

Kirk W0HNV reported the repeater equipment is starting to age quite
badly and needs work. Controllers are obsolete and suggested to upgrade
the system. He would like to have the same equipment at all locations
for consistency and so the club can have spares. The VXR7000 has been
discontinued, but the club can get other repeaters. He noted all the
repeaters don't necessarily need to be replaced at once. Jake K0RQ
suggested the club move on this before the repeater system falls into
further disrepair. Eli K0PPE appointed a committee of Kirk W0HNV, Jake
K0RQ, Andy KD0IOE, Jarod W0JPJ, and Mark KC0SHM to look at options. Mark
suggested we look at finances before proceeding with anything.

#### Education

Kirk W0HNV reported there are no classes scheduled and no candidates are
asking for classes. Maple Grove Radio Club is doing classes on Zoom as
well.

#### Hamfest

Anton KC0PFS is now the committee chair. First meeting will be May
10<sup>th</sup> at 7pm on Zoom. This is the last year contracted for the Red
River Valley Fairground, but the club is penciled in for 2023. Lori
KC0GQE added that payment has been made for this year. Rent for 2023
goes to \$1400 and \$200 for the extra room. Seth KC0ODE moved to
do a three contract for hamfest. Pete WC0G seconded. Motion carried
unanimously.

#### VE

Pete WC0G reported there is not a lot of interest in VE Testing. There
was one request, but it was short notice. ARRL is also working on a
program to get new hams under 18, mainly to subsidize their fees.
