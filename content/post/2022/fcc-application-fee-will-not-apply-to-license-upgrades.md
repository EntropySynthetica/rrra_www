On April 4, 2022, ARRL News reported:

>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) staff has clarified in response
>to an ARRL request that the new $35 application fee will not apply to most
>license modifications, including those to upgrade anamateur radio licensee's
>operator class and changes to club station trustees. The FCC staff explained
>that the new fees will apply only to applications for a new license, renewal,
>rule waiver, or a new vanity call sign. As previously announced, the new fees
>take effect on April 19, 2022.

>"We are pleased that the FCC will not charge licensees the FCC application
>fee for license upgrade applications," said ARRL Volunteer Examiner
>Coordinator (VEC) Manager Maria Somma, AB1FM. "While applicants for a new
>license will need to pay the $35 FCC application fee, there will be no FCC
>charge for future upgrades and administrative updates, such as a change of
>mailing or email address. Most current licensees, therefore, will not be
>charged the new FCC application fee until they renew their license or apply
>for a new vanity call sign."
>
>ARRL previously reported that the new $35 application fee for amateur radio
>licenses will become effective on April 19, 2022. Further information and
>instructions about the FCC Application Fee are available from the ARRL VEC at
>www.arrl.org/fcc-application-fee. [^1]
