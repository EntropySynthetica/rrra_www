It's time to start planning for the 2022 ARRL Dakota Division Convention
and RRRA Hamfest. This is the largest Hamfest in North Dakota drawing
attendees from 3 states and 1 Canadian province. Committee members
are needed to plan and run this major fund raising activity for our
club. Lots of volunteers will make the work easy for everyone.

Hamfest Committee Meetings will be listed in our homepage ***Upcoming
Events*** section and in the
[Hamfest Committee Dates index](/dates/hamfest-committee).

The Hamfest Committee will use a mailing list for coordination and to
assist the planning process; volunteers are asked to
[subscribe to the hamfest mailing list]({{< relref "/post/2022/hamfest-committee-members-needed.md#subscribing-to-the-mailing-list" >}})
so that they can stay informed and be a part of the conversation.
Volunteers may subscribe multiple addresses (e.g. work and mobile
e-mail) if desired.

**Returning volunteers must re-subscribe to the hamfest list to confirm
their participation.**
