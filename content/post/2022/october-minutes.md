## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports

#### ARES

No ARES discussion tonight

#### Technicals

Kirk W0HNV reported that the new repeaters have had extensive bench
testing, particularly the Grandin repeater. The Grandin repeater will
be going up soon, to provide better communications coverage. Grandin
repeater will be running 25 watts of output, but is rated for 100% duty
cycle at that power.

It is expected that this site will allow repeater use between
Fargo all the way to Grand Forks.

There were additional items that needed to be purchased
to maintain existing repeater sites

* Motion for disbursement of \$145.57 for replacement parts by
Kirk W0HNV
* Seconded by Mark KC0SHM
* Motion passed

#### Education

Kirk W0HNV reported that Jay WS0Y will be re-doing the technician class
a bit to better cover a chapter. No classes have been scheduled as of
the October meeting. A general class is expected to come up, and an
extra class beginning sometime next year (2023).

#### Hamfest

Anton KC0PFS thanked everyone for their help and presence at the
Hamfest. The club was able to make \$1,242.71 after all expenses. The
online ticket sales appeared to be a great hit, the info screens was a
huge help too. We hope to have more volunteers for next year.

As of now there is no secured venue for the 2023 Hamfest. The Red River Valley
Fairgrounds are adjusting their prices and will be increasing the amount they
charge the club. Potentially a 2-3x price hike, which would require a
sponsorship or some other fundraising to make it affordable.

The next Hamfest committee meeting will be Nov 8th via zoom at 7pm.

This year went well.

Bill AC0W asked how many people were attending, rough estimate was 150.

#### VE

Pete WC0G reported that there was No internet at the testing session
at the Hamfest. Unfortunately there were only 6 people testing at the
hamfest this year. Test interest has greatly dropped around the area,
many open slots for online testing.

If required, tests can be given 1 at a time via zoom, as requested.

#### Media

Steve K0STK stated his report is the contents of the 2022-10
Publications Committee folder at https://cloud.rrra.org/. Any questions

### Old Business

#### Bylaw Changes

Tabled until November meeting.

Waiting until the next month for a first reading. If you have any issues
or concerns with the changes please contact Steve K0STK or Seth KC0ODE.

### New Business

#### Antenna Trailer Donation

A group from the Twin Cities area, MN, is looking to donate a mobile
tower to a midwest club. If we would like to apply to receive it, we
need to write and submit a letter to express our interest.

Mark KC0SHM asked where we will put it when we are not using it, and
if there is any problem with it. Mark asked if there would be any
yearly maintenance and costs.

Andy KD0IOE mentioned that it should be in good shape and well
maintained.

Lori KC0GQE mentioned we should pass on it, due to a lack of space to
put it and few ideas for use.

### Good of the Order

* The
[RRRA Christmas Party]({{< relref "/calendar/2022/rrra-christmas-party.md" >}})
is on December 7th at the Dilworth Pizza Ranch. It starts at 5pm. Please
bring a non-perishable food donation or a cash donation for the Dorothy
Day house.

* The club received a donation from the estate of WA0HSU. There
are a few transceivers, CBs, and other various things. Steve
K0STK will hold onto these items for now.
