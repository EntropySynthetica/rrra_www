[This 25 minute documentary](https://www.montanapbs.org/programs/ham/)
begins in 1983 with NASA Astronaut 
[Owen K. Garriott W5LFL (SK)](https://silentkeyhq.com/main.php?p=bin/NSKALookup.php&dlnk=&call=W5LFL&uid=0351555394039246)
 calling CQ with an HT over the US West Coast
from the Space Shuttle Columbia, a brief pile-up, and his first contact
from orbit: WA1JXM from Montana.

The story *fast forwards* to 2022 where we meet four Montana
Hams---Lance WA1JXM,
Mike [K7MSO](https://www.qrz.com/db/K7MSO),
Dennis [KR7Q](https://www.qrz.com/db/KR7Q),
and Keith [NE7R](https://www.qrz.com/db/NE7R)---and learn about
their backgrounds and how they are involved in the hobby.

Featuring stunning Montana landscapes and tasteful shack and rig
photography, the documentary includes discussions of 6M Moonbounce,
POTA, DXpeditions (including footage from Clipperton Island), and FT8,
along with many well chosen images. And archival footage of salient
quotes from Vic Clark W4KFC, former ARRL President, and a young David
Sumner K1ZZ, former ARRL CEO.

There's even the obligatory commentary on CW vs phone operators.

The documentary concludes with a very accurate summarization of
Ham Radio from WA1JMX, "[it is] a wonderful way to bring the world
together."

Viewers who watch to the end of the closing credits will see that the
film makers did understand their subject matter.
