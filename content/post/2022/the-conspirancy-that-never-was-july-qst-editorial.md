ARRL has built an infrastructure for EmComm within our
public service organization that we call the Amateur Radio
Emergency Service&reg;, or ARES&reg;. This is both an organiza-
tion and a framework for people to volunteer, take needed
training, join a local group, and then practice or drill to
ensure readiness when required. It is the responsibility of
your Section Manager to ensure that the position of Section
Emergency Coordinator (SEC) is staffed and managing
emergency communications.
