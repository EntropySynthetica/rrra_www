### About the Expo

>Amateur radio is like a big circus.  It has its main tent with three rings in
>the center.  In those rings could be Contesting, DXing, and Rag Chewing.
>However, amateur radio now has a "midway of a thousand smaller tents"
>according to Eric Guth, 4Z1UG, founder of the QSO Today Virtual Ham Expo, and
>host of the QSO Today Podcast, a interview program featuring the most
>interesting amateur radio operators.  It is exactly this midway that the
>"Expo" was founded to explore.
>
>The Expo has ... become the place to discover more niches in amateur radio
>through the presentations given at each one.  In March 2021, while there was
>some difficulty with the platforms, over 6000 hams came and viewed almost
>100,000 presentations from the over 80 that were offered in March.  [The] Expo
>in August 2021 had over 90 presentations in 8 tracks of amazing amateur radio
>content. [^3]

### About QSO Today

>QSO Today is a podcast about the international hobby of amateur radio
>also known as ham radio. Every week, [Eric 4Z1UG / WA6IGR interviews] a
>"ham" to hear their ham radio story and what they are doing now. Many
>of the technologies that we enjoy today including television and radio,
>cell phones, computers, and the Internet were born out amateur radio
>hobbyists experimenting with electronics and radio in their basements
>and garages. Amateur radio was and still is the frontier where hams
>conducted electronic experiments in order to make that wireless contact
>around the World.
>
>As a kid growing up in Southern California during the 60s, amateur
>radio was Eric's ticket to electronics, science, and technology. Its
>hams were [his] mentors. These interviews allow [Eric] to share the ham
>radio stories to inspire you to join this amazing hobby, or if you are
>already here, to grow and learn more from these stories. [^2]
