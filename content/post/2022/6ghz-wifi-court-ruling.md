This ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit does not appear to impact Amateur Radio Super High
Frequency
([SHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_high_frequency)) operation
since---according to the
[ARRL US Amateur Radio Frequency Allocations page](http://www.arrl.org/frequency-allocations) and 
[Wikipedia ITU Region 2 frequency allocation
chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#ITU_Region_2)---the
6GHz band is outside the Amateur Radio 5cm allocation (5.650--5.925 GHz).
