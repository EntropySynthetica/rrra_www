Days before the end of the current congressional session,
[Congresswoman Debbie Lesko \(AZ-08\)](https://lesko.house.gov/)
introduced a bill in the U.S.  House of Representatives
([H.R. 9664](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr9664))
on December 21, 2022, to require that the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC)
[replace the current HF digital symbol rate limit with a 2.8 kHz bandwidth limit](https://lesko.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=2763).

Unfortunately due to the timing of the introduction of this minor
piece of legislation there is little chance of its consideration
during the current congressional session.
