description = "Make a Two-Meter J-Pole Antenna from Lamp Cord: Building an antenna doesn’t have to involve yards of aluminum tubing and long runs of coax. It can be as simple as soldering and snipping (carefully!) a length of lamp cord. Frequent On the Air and QST contributor Dino Papas, KL0S, provides insight into the construction and tuning of this J-pole antenna, which he built for On the Air from a design by John H. Unrath, K6JHU. Along the way he and host Becky Schoenfeld, W1BXY, uncover a bit of J-pole history and dig into why an antenna analyzer is a must-have if you decide to build this project."
