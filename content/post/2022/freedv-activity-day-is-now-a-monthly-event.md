Contribute to the advancement of radio art by participating in the (now) monthly
[FreeDV](https://freedv.org/) 48 hour Activity Day. On the third weekend of
each month you can join other FreeDV users on the air for QSOs and a fun
time.

"As this isn't a contest, there's no pressure to make contacts or send logs, but
you can always confirm QSOs via the usual means if you'd like (LoTW, eQSL, QRZ,
etc.) Enabling PSK Reporter in the FreeDV application and joining the
[QSO Finder](http://qso.freedv.org/)
are recommended, however, so others can see that you're on the air and hearing
them (for instance, here's

### About FreeDV

>FreeDV is a Digital Voice mode for HF radio. You can run FreeDV using a free
>GUI application for Windows, Linux and OSX that allows any SSB radio to be
>used for low-bit-rate digital voice.
>
>FreeDV is being developed by an international team of radio amateurs working
>together on coding, design, user interface and testing. FreeDV is open source
>software, released under the GNU Lesser Public License version 2.1. The modems
>and Codec 2 speech codec used in FreeDV are also open source.
>
>Amateur Radio is transitioning from analog to digital, much as it transitioned
>from AM to SSB in the 1950s and 1960s. How would you feel if one or two
>companies owned the patents for SSB, then forced you to use their technology,
>made it illegal to experiment with or even understand the technology, and
>insisted you stay locked to it for the next 100 years? That's exactly what was
>happening with digital voice. But now, hams are in control of their technology
>again!
>
>FreeDV is unique as it uses 100% Open Source Software, including the speech
>codec. No secrets, nothing proprietary! FreeDV represents a path for
>21st-century Amateur Radio where Hams are free to experiment and innovate,
>rather than a future locked into a single manufacturer's closed technology.
