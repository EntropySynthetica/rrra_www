## Wishing the best to everyone.

Fortunately, the worst of hurricanes Helene and Milton are in the
past. The effected communities have had time to evaluate the damage
and hopefully found reasons to be grateful. For the rest of us, we can
assist as needed, pray for their recovery, and do some self reflection
on what we can learn from others’ experiences.

## Self reflection beyond Helene and Milton.

As much as we’d like to think calamities happen to someone else, there
is no part of the country that is not at risk form some type of natural
disaster. *Off Grid Ham* is not a "survivalist website", so we’ll
focus on communications/alternative power topics and leave discussions
about other preparations to those who are more qualified to comment.

Take some time and analyze where you live. What types of disasters are
likely? How long do you think the event would last? Who would you need
to communicate with in this situation, and why? What will happen if you
are unable to contact these people?

## Points to consider.

***When public safety agencies order an evacuation, listen to them!***
The best way to survive a disaster is to not be there in the first
place. I understand why some folks might be reluctant to leave. When
it’s all over though, your reasons will not matter if you are dead.
Your presence is not going to stop the adverse event or make the
situation better. You may in fact make it worse. Hanging around does not
not prove anything or make one a hero. Get out when told.

<p class="clear"></p>

***Have a portable radio/go box ready well in advance.*** Even if you
are not in an evacuation zone, chances are pretty good you will still
face some adverse conditions. If you have a fixed home station, do not
presume it will be operable after the event. Your antenna may be down.
The power may be out. You may temporarily have to relocate nearby, such
as a neighbor’s house, a garage, or even your car. Having radio gear
you can bring along will assure that you can still stay connected.

***Communications should not be your top priority.*** This may sound odd
coming from a website dedicated solely to communications, but it’s
the truth. Once the immediate danger passes, your top priorities should
be assessing damage, assisting those in need, and maintaining your own
health and safety. Jumping on the air for anything other than support
for the preceding reasons accomplishes nothing and clutters the radio
bands. Welfare messages to assure distant friends/family and routine
weather/situation reports are not essential and should be delayed until
after more urgent needs are addressed. 

***Have a communications plan.*** Prepare a list of frequencies
important to your locale and have them pre-programmed in your equipment.
Give yourself several options since repeaters may be offline. Whenever
possible, plan in advance with other hams close enough to contact
via simplex so you can provide relays and pass messages. You do
not necessarily have to team up with these hams for mutual aid in
other aspects (shelter, food, fuel, etc.) but having a functional
communications network is essential. 

***Assume you will not have internet access.*** Drill this into
your head: Any form of ham radio that involves the internet is by
definition not "off grid"! If your comms plan relies heavily on
the internet, it’s absolutely imperative to have a “plan B”
for when it’s down. This includes support resources not directly
related to on-air operations. Any important manuals, programming
instructions, calculators, how-to information, frequency lists, maps,
diagrams, schematics, photos, etc., should be kept in printed form or
on locally-accessible digital media (not on the cloud or a server).
Preferably, have more than one copy. If you run into a problem, you may
not be able to find the solution with a quick google or YouTube search.

***Have a reasonable stock of supplies and spare parts.*** This is
kind of a no-brainer. Don’t let your entire communications system be
crippled by a blown fuse. Stock a small supply of fuses, connectors,
patch cables, small batteries (AA, D, 9v, etc.), electrician’s tape,
heat shrink tube, solder, and any other odds and ends you might need
to stay on the air. Also, have ready any hand tools you might need to
complete the repairs.

## Be careful to whom you listen.

One great way to prepare for disasters is to learn from those who have
been through one. The internet is full of know-it-alls, but very few
of them have any direct experience. One very popular US-based blogger
has established himself as a "survival expert". His website grabs
millions of hits every month and he earns a lucrative income as a
"consultant". Yet, he’s never personally been tested himself.

That’s not to say these people are universally not worth listening
to, or they cannot know anything unless they’ve done it. After all, I
haven’t been involved in a disaster either, yet here I am dispensing
advice and expecting to be taken seriously. You don’t need to break a
bone to know breaking a bone hurts!

What this does mean is that you should be very cognizant of to whom you
listen. Some of these content creators actually know what they’re
talking about. Others mean well but offer incorrect or impractical
information. A small number are straight up frauds. Still others are
"professional survivalists", ie, influencers who may or may not
be authoritative. Their primary goal is profit via clicks or sponsor
promotion.

Lastly, ***listen to your gut!*** Intuition is powerful. If something
doesn’t seem right, it probably isn’t. Skills, equipment, and
experience mean absolutely zero without common sense and "street
smarts". Success in this area means being able to read a situation and
not base decisions on peer pressure or trying to look good to others .
Many if not most people who think they possess these "soft skills"
actually don’t. This deficiency can be countered by surrounding
oneself with wise people. Be honest with yourself, because a bad call
can mean a disaster on top of the disaster you’re already facing.

Learning is an ongoing process, and no one can ever know everything.
With a little common sense and some competent advice, you can greatly
increase your odds of not being a statistic.
