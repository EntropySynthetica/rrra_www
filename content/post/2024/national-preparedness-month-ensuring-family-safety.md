September is National Preparedness Month. In coordination with our
partners at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the ARRL
Amateur Radio Emergency Service® (ARES®) is producing a series of
weekly articles to help radio amateurs and their families stay safe.

For a ham or any other public safety responder, whether paid or
volunteer, it is not uncommon to be called out to provide assistance
during disasters. We often do not know when we will be called or exactly
what the call will involve. We also do not know how long we may be
deployed. In the last edition, we focused on our go kit and the tools we
should have to deploy as an amateur radio volunteer. But have we made
sure our family is prepared for these times, whether we are deployed or
will be staying home?

As the theme of this month suggests, ARRL Director of Emergency
Management Josh Johnston, KE5MHV, says it comes down to being prepared.
“Make a plan with your family and ensure basic supplies are available
including water, food and first aid capabilities. Do you have a
generator or alternate power capabilities and do your family members
know how to use it? Have a communications plan, including backup
communications, with family members and friends,” he said.

Johnston says to ensure your family knows where to go if they must
evacuate for some reason. Always remember your family and your health
and safety should always come first.

“Remember that there may be a time that you are the victim. There
may be a time that you must turn down a request for assistance because
you must take care of your family first. Ask if you can be put in a
slot later down the roster to allow time to get your family to safety
or have everything settled to ensure your family is cared for before
deployment,” said Johnston.

ARRL recognizes the tremendous work ham radio volunteers put into
serving their communities. “If your mind is not on the mission, you
may be putting yourself and others at risk. Therefore, you should ensure
your family’s wellbeing before, during and after a major event,”
Johnston continued.
