[On] December 7 we remember the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese
forces that killed more than 2,000 servicemembers and 68 civilians in
1941. It was a devastating act of aggression on U.S. soil, thrusting an
entire country into a war and calling on everyone to contribute to the
cause overseas and back home---including operators in the 
[Amateur Radio Relay League \(ARRL\)](https://www.arrl.org/).

Established in 1914 (celebrating its 110th anniversary this year), the
ARRL’s contribution to the war effort cannot be understated. That’s
because amateur radio almost didn’t exist during the war, but the ARRL
showed the country how vital it could be.

Following the attack, amateur radio communications were completely
halted by order of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). This was
to prevent interference with military communications and to keep amateur
radio operators out of the hands of foreign stations.

However, the ARRL saw the potential a radio service could have in
protecting the nation and pushed for the FCC to incorporate it in civil
defense. They believed that a ham’s emergency radio preparedness and
their capabilities and readiness to serve the nation could help protect
it, wrote Bart Lee, K6VK, in an article about emergency operating in San
Francisco during the war.

It made sense---the ARRL had already formed the
[Amateur Radio Emergency Services \(ARES\)](https://www.onallbands.com/word-of-the-day-what-is-ares/)
in 1935 with the Radio Amateurs of Canada. Still in existence today,
ARES’ purpose is to help those in need when disasters like hurricanes
and wildfires damage critical communication infrastructure.

So, in 1942, the FCC formed the War Emergency Radio Service (WERS). Its
purpose was to alert others in the event of an air raid or an invasion.
It also functioned the same as ARES in the event of a natural disaster.

WERS was made up of multiple, small shortwave transmitters and receivers
reporting to central stations working on VHF. The intention of the
service was for communications up to about 10 miles, so power was
restricted to 25 watts. It was recommended by the Office of Civilian
Defense that home equipment using salvaged parts be used to avoid using
items not readily available during the war.

Instead of individual operators getting licensed, WERS’ licenses were
only given to entire communities, but participants still needed an
amateur radio license to use WERS frequencies.

At the end of 1944, the service included about 5,000 transmitters
operated under 250 licenses.

While it never raised the alarm on an invasion or air raid, WERS was
used for several disasters throughout wartime. These included providing
communications for the flood of the Mississippi and Lake Erie in 1942,
the Atlantic Coast hurricane of 1944, and a snowstorm in western New
York in 1945, according to K6VK.

WERS ended in 1945, just after the war. In its place, the
[Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service \(RACES\)](https://www.onallbands.com/word-of-the-day-races-the-radio-amateur-civil-emergency-service/)
was created and still stands today. Formed in 1952, it was designed to
quickly silence regular amateur radio if the sitting president of the
United States invoked the War Powers Act of 1941. It also helps during a
plethora of different disasters ranging from natural to technological.

RACES has provided vital communications assistance during a range
of disasters, including hurricanes Katrina and Maria, the Northeast
blackout of 2003, and the Twin Towers attacks on September 11.

In honor of the ARRL’s 110th anniversary and everything it has
contributed not only to the world of amateur radio but to the defense of
the country and its communities, OnAllBands wants to say thanks!
