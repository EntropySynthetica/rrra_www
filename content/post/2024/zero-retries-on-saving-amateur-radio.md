In Zero Retries newsletter 135, Editor Steve Stroh N8GNJ inaugurated a
series of articles about the future of Amateur Radio with one titled
[Techies, Data Communications, and Experimentation with New Radio Technologies Could "Save" Amateur Radio](https://www.zeroretries.org/i/140634724/techies-data-communications-and-experimentation-with-new-radio-technologies-could-save-amateur-radio)
which starts with:

>There's a lot happening in Amateur Radio, and especially Amateur
>Radio in the US. Taken at face value, there are a number of trends that are
>troubling, to the point that some folks
>[seem to consider Amateur Radio a lost cause](https://ke9v.net/2024/01/19/looking-for-work.html).
> While this discussion will at first seem like it's
>"Amateur Radio Politics" (which I generally try to avoid in
>Zero Retries"), these preliminary points are presented in service to Zero
>Retries' mission:

>**... promoting technological innovation that is occurring in Amateur Radio,
>and Amateur Radio as (literally) a license to experiment with and learn about

N8GNJ then presents and discusses these points

* The numbers of Amateur Radio Operators (not just in the US) are declining.
* The influence of the ARRL will inevitably decline as a result of
disgust at the Board of Directors infighting and dues (subscription)
price increases.
* The use of voice VHF / UHF repeaters are significantly reduced, year to year.
* Emergency Communications has subtly become less of a justification for
Amateur Radio. Simultaneously ...
    * In the 2020s and beyond, First Responders have more, and more
reliable communications options than ever before.
    * Communications infrastructure available to most individuals has
become more concentrated and fragile.
* COVID-19 and other factors have impacted many Amateur Radio club
meetings and other reasons for Amateur Radio in-person events.
* The potential audience of younger folks to become new Amateur Radio
Operators just don't find "talking to strangers" or "operating on
shortwave" to be compelling reasons to become Amateur Radio Operators.

In his final point---The "Solution" for the above? Reimagine Amateur
Radio to attract techies---N8GNJ presents some potential solutions.
