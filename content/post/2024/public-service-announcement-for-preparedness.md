Zero Retries Editor’s Note - In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene,
there is water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink. My thanks to
N2IRZ for these very good, basic points about survival in a disaster.
***Without the basics of life, like safe water, and especially enough
safe water, the "nice to haves" like communications won’t make a
difference.***

Disasters generally affect infrastructure, and it universally takes
at least a few days to respond to these effects. Consider [Hurricane]
Helene and Western North Carolina: Major flooding significantly damaged
power and water infrastructure, and washouts and fallen trees rendered
virtually every road impassable, delaying emergency response for a few
days. No water, no food, no power and no help on the way. How will you
(literally) survive?

In NC, some local supermarkets have generators and so were able to help
some residents with food and water, but this disappeared quickly. We
all know that we can survive a week or two without food (uncomfortably,
perhaps) but more than a day or two without drinking water can be fatal.

The point is that some simple steps can prepare you to survive a
disaster. Keep at least 3 days’ worth of water and nonperishable food
stashed away. Plan on at least one gallon a day per person for water,
and dry or canned food that can be eaten as-is. This is above and beyond
what’s in the cupboard right now. Pets have needs too, perhaps less
water but more food, as pet supplies may not recover for weeks. And
don’t forget some money, in smaller bills and change, since banks and
ATMs, as well as credit-card processing, will be unavailable for a week
or more.

Don’t forget everyday items you will need, like a can opener, some
butane lighters (to light a fire), and other supplies (like plates,
cups, toilet paper, soap), since the contents of your home might be
completely unusable. Start today by making a list of what you think
you’ll need, then start collecting it. Buy products with distant
‘best-by’ dates, sticking to the cheapest brands because you’ll
hopefully never eat it, but if you have to, it’ll still keep you
alive: Perrier is no better than Costco water in a disaster.

If you take absolutely essential-to-life medications, have a week’s
supply (or more) stored separately, replacing it every few months.

Store it all in a plastic tub, safe from floods and somewhat physically
protected from damage. Refresh the contents every year on your birthday,
perhaps donating the older packages to a local food pantry.

You can probably think of other useful supplies, like a generator and
fuel, a deck of cards to pass the time, or insect repellent, but the
point is to start helping yourself help yourself and avoid being a
victim.
