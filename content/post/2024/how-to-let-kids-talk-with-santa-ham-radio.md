Santa Claus will be on the amateur radio airwaves again this year.
<!--more-->

The 3.916 Santa Net will be on the air every night at 7:00 PM CST from
November 29 through December 24. Reserve a spot with Santa by making a
pre-net check in. You can check in each night starting at 6:30 PM CST
online at www.CQSanta.com.

Santa and Mrs. Claus will also be on the air, together, thanks to
special arrangements with the
[Cowley \(KS\) County Amateur Radio Club](http://cowleyarc.org/).
They will be on the air on the 147.000 repeater and the Sunflower Net
system, between 10 a.m. and noon on November 30 and beginning at 10 a.m.
on December 14 and 21. In addition to the local repeater, the
[Sunflower Net](http://www.sunflowernet.us/)
offers connection options to Allstar, DMR, Dstar, Echolink, Fusion,
Hamshack Hotline, M17, and P25. The club is also setting up a radio link
at the local library to talk to Santa.

Also, for the 4th year, Santa has sent Elf Chucky and his team of
amateur radio operators to northern Colorado, to help make sure children
of all ages can talk to Santa on station NÃ˜P from the North Pole.
Thanks to the
[Longmont Amateur Radio Club](http://w0eno.org/) and the
[Northern Colorado Amateur Radio Club](http://www.ncarc.net/?q=node/1),
children can get into the holiday spirit by talking to Santa on the
radio. Both are ARRL Affiliated Clubs. Get the details on that operation
at https://w0eno.org/santa/.
