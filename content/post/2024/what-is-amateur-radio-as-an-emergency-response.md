I recently discussed some of the notions of amateur radio as emergency
response. The idea that you might jump into the breach and be a hero is
appealing and often celebrated.

The American Radio Relay League, or ARRL, proudly tells the story of two
amateur radio emergency communication events. One, of a person who fell
in their bathroom and happened to have a handheld radio that they used
to contact another amateur who contacted emergency services. The story
goes on to say that being part of the Amateur Radio Emergency Services
or ARES had taught the amateurs the ITU phonetic alphabet, as-if that's
not a requirement for getting your amateur license. Then there's the
story of two teenagers who were critically injured in a remote area and
amateur radio rescued them due to a contact with a random local amateur.
Never mind that there was a local off-duty EMT who actually stabilised
the patients.

While you might point at this as *amateur radio to the rescue*, to me
this is a case of people attempting to make the story about amateur
radio. If the person in the bathroom happened to have a mobile phone
nearby, the story would not have even made the nightly news and if
the people in the remote area had actually prepared properly, they'd
have had an emergency position-indicating radiobeacon or EPIRB and a
satellite phone, rather than accidentally bumping into a random radio
amateur.

Moving on. Have you ever noticed that your mobile phone stops working
after a couple of hours during a power outage? It's because mobile
phone towers run on batteries that depending on load might last up to
12 hours, often much less than that, anywhere from down when the power
goes out to 3 hours until the batteries fail. Note that I'm not talking
about the battery in your phone, I'm talking about the ones in the tower
serving your phone.

I mentioned previously that there was a network outage affecting 40% of
the Australian population. The get-out-of jail card was that the rest
of the population still had mobile, landline and internet connectivity.
What would happen if the other network operator also went down?

Is there a place for amateur radio in those scenarios?

Let's explore. If all mobile, telephone and internet networks were down,
what would that look like? Could you call an ambulance or the fire
department using amateur radio? Who would you talk to, on what frequency
and on which radio would they be listening? Would you set up your
portable shack in the local hospital or fire station? Would ambulances
and fire services be able to coordinate during such an outage, or would
you have your local amateur club ride-along on every ambulance and fire
truck?

What does such a system look like in actuality? Has there been any
planning or training for this? Are there refresher courses and special
certifications? Does your local community have anything like this in
place, or are you starting from scratch?

During widespread and long lasting fire emergencies in Australia, radio
amateurs have acted as emergency services radio operators. There is at
least one amateur club where, years ago, the members underwent special
training with the local State Emergency Services to learn their language
and procedures, just in case it becomes short staffed when an actual
emergency occurs.

I've often said that doing contests is a good way to learn how best to
operate your station and how to work in adverse environments with lots
of interference, man-made or otherwise. The reality is that it's more
likely than not that you'll be using a line-of-sight FM radio in the
emergency services communications bunker than sitting in the rubble of
your shack using HF with a wire antenna running off battery trying to
get someone, anyone, to help you and your community.

There are official amateur radio emergency organisations, WICEN in
Australia, ARES and RACES in the United States. Much is made by these
organisations about joining and training, but very little in the way of
actual emergency response. Is that a marketing issue, or are these types
of organisations obsolete and waiting to be disbanded?

My point is this.

**If amateur radio is really a service as the WIA states, *A Trusted
Partner in Emergency Response*, or as the ARRL puts it, *When All Else
Fails*, even making that a registered trademark, where is the evidence
of their activity, where are the annual reports, the after action
lessons learnt, the inter-team competitions, the talks at local clubs,
the league tables of emergencies handled, lives saved and babies born?**

To give you insight into just how broken this is, any licensed amateur
can become a member of ARES, but you can only read their newsletter if
you're a member of the ARRL. In Australia, for a while, the WIA offered
a course for Public Safety Training for Radio Amateurs, but only to
amateurs with an Advanced license, which I discovered after spending
$633.92 to print out, collate and bind the 973 pages of course material,
as-if those of a lesser amateur radio qualification somehow were less
able to read a map, operate communications equipment, follow defined
occupational health and safety policies and procedures, work effectively
in a public safety organisation, as part of a team, or in an emergency
operations centre.

So, what's your plan for providing amateur radio as a service?
