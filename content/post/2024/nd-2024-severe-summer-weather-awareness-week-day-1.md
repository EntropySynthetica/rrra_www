### Severe Thunderstorm Safety Tips

Stay away from windows!! Flying debris and wind driven hail can break
windows sending shards of glass through the air.

If camping, seek shelter inside a sturdy building as campers/RVs can be
easily flipped by damaging winds associated with severe thunderstorms.
Falling trees and large hail can easily penetrate the thin walls of a
tent.

Those in mobile homes should go to their designated storm shelter.
Destructive straight-line winds are capable of causing significant
damage to mobile homes.

Severe thunderstorms are capable of producing tornadoes with little
warning. Stay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your favorite media outlet
for frequent weather updates.
