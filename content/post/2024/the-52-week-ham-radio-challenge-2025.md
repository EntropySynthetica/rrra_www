<!--more-->

>* This [challenge] is meant to **inspire you to extend your horizons** in amateur radio [through] weekly challenges that touch all aspects of ham radio (and related fields, such as IT).
>* A lot of the challenges may be trivial for some participants (because it is what they do all the time), but very challenging to others.
>* Participants of the challenge are encouraged to help each other in any way possible. There's no cheating and you decide on your own success or failure.
>* The challenges may be done in the suggested chronolgical order, or in any other way you like. For maximum synergy and fun in comparing how it's going, going chronologically is recommended!
>* Participants are encouraged to post their progress, ideas, questions on Mastodon with the tag [#hamchallenge](https://mastodon.radio/tags/HAMChallenge) and on [irc.libera.chat/#hamchallenge](https://irc.libera.chat/#hamchallenge)
>* You're encouraged to make use of your own equipment as much as possible, but it is perfectly OK to use borrowed equipment, or use WebSDRs/KiwiSDRs or other remote setups.
>* There will be a scoreboard, that will be automatically created based on reports on Mastodon using the #hamchallenge tag (TBD) [^1]
