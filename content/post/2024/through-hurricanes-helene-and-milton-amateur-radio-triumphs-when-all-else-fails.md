**While some residents in hurricane-impacted areas can’t send texts or
make calls, amateur radio enthusiasts are helping communicate requests
for help and messages between loved ones.**

The morning after Hurricane Helene pummeled the eastern seaboard of
the US, Thomas Witherspoon inspected the damage to his western North
Carolina home. The night before, he listened to the wind whip down trees
and snap power lines along the two-mile access road connecting his
family to their few neighbors in Buncombe County.

Like the tens of thousands of other North Carolina residents, the power
to Witherspoon’s neighborhood
[was completely out](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/10/06/north-carolina-power-outage-map-sunday-hurricane-helene/75543174007/).
It was impossible to communicate with the house down the road, let
alone anyone several miles away. Unable to send text messages or
make phone calls, radio became the one form of communication left in
rural North Carolina. After fixing what he could on his own property,
Witherspoon, a lifelong amateur radio enthusiast, began distributing
handheld radios to his neighbors.

"Amateur radio is one of those things you get into because of your
love of radio communications and the technical aspects of it or the
community and the challenges that you can overcome," Witherspoon says.
"It's a lot of fun, but underlying all of that is this prime directive
with amateur radio that it’s always there as emergency communications
when all else fails."

Other amateur radio enthusiasts have helped out as well. Last Tuesday,
operators fielded requests for medications, like insulin, and announced
when grocery stores, like Sam’s Club, reopened. Most of the messages
were to let friends and family know that they’re OK.

"Mom, your son is OK. No phone service. Happy birthday," WIRED heard
a caller ask an operator to send his mother during a livestream of the
broadcast.

Hurricanes have wreaked havoc on the United States over the past month.
More than 200 people have been confirmed dead as a result of Helene and
many more have gone missing, making it the most destructive US hurricane
since Katrina in 2005. Nearly a week after Helene made landfall, cell
service dead zones plagued the Carolinas, leaving thousands of residents
unable to reach their friends, families, and even emergency responders.
As Hurricane Milton builds in the Gulf of Mexico this week, radio
operators in Florida are also preparing to launch their net---a group
of operators communicating live over the air. Scott Roberts, an amateur
radio section manager for northern Florida, said that operators in his
area started checking their equipment and making plans to deploy to
shelters as of Monday.

There are more than 1 million licensed radio amateurs in the US
like Witherspoon and Roberts, according to a Federal Communications
Commission spokesperson who spoke to WIRED last week. Some amateur radio
bands are short bands, reaching only small communities of people, while
others cover hundreds and even thousands of miles. When communication
infrastructure fails, like cellular networks during a natural disaster,
the FCC allows for amateur radio operators to assist in recovery
efforts.

Gordon Mooneyhan, spokesperson for the American Radio Relay League, said
he knows of three main repeaters being used to convey messages inside
the disaster area from Hurricane Helene, including the Mt. Mitchell
Repeater, which is located at the highest point in North Carolina at
6,600 feet and boosts localized radio broadcasts to a wider network.
This is where Witherspoon read off supply requests and road closures.

Messages are sent digitally using what is essentially a modem, linking a
computer to the radio and turning the messages into a form of high-speed
morse code with the Winlink Global Radio Email system.

"You type the message, and it will automatically calculate the word
count and send it to the next station," says Mooneyhan. "The next
station automatically sends back what the word count is supposed to be,
so it’s all verified and there aren’t any errors."

Whether a message out of the disaster zone is bound for a neighboring
state or a family member in Asia, there are operators everywhere capable
of getting it where it needs to go.

"You wanna go to Texas? They’ll find a net that’s taking traffic
to Texas, sign in, relay the message, and deliver it," says Mooneyhan.

As of Monday, telecommunications companies were still putting up
temporary towers to restore cell phone connectivity in North Carolina.
AT&T and T-Mobile have deployed mobile units where residents can drive
to connect their phones to Wi-Fi and send messages. For many residents,
the simplest method of reaching a loved one is speaking into a handheld
radio.

Hurricane Milton grew into a category 5 storm on Monday, and amateur
radio operators in Florida are already preparing to respond if the
state’s communications infrastructure fails.

"Florida amateur radio operators are perfectly equipped to handle
Hurricane Milton, even just after Hurricane Helene," says Josh
Johnston, the director of emergency management for the Amateur Radio
Emergency Service. "They have the systems in place and have a
well-refined action plan in each county, as well as at the state level.
They're quite accustomed to busy storm seasons, and ready to provide
critical information to served agencies as Milton comes through."

"It’s not as nice as getting a phone call from a loved one," says
Mooneyhan, "but if you’re in an area where the cell service and land
lines are totally disrupted, a message saying *I’m OK, everyone’s
fine, don’t worry,* that beats the heck out of not knowing."
