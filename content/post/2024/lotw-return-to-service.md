On July 1, 2024, [ARRL](https://www.arrl.org) announced the return of the
Logbook of The World QSO verification service in their
[ARRL System Services Disruption](http://www.arrl.org/news/arrl-systems-service-disruption)
bulletin.
<!--more-->

>Effective 12:00pm ET / 16:00 UTC we will be returning
>[Logbook of The World&reg;](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotwuser/default)
>([LoTW&reg;](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotwuser/default))
>to service. 
>
>As work progressed on the network, some users encountered LoTW opening
>briefly during which some 6600 logs were uploaded. The logs were not
>processed until this weekend as we tested that the interfaces to LoTW
>were functioning properly.
>
>We are taking steps to help manage what will likely be a huge influx
>of logs. We are requesting that if you have large uploads, perhaps
>from contests or from a DXpedition, please wait a week or two before
>uploading to give LoTW a chance to catch up. We have also implemented
>a process to reject logs with excessive duplicates. Please do not
>upload your entire log to *ensure* your contacts are in LoTW as they
>will be rejected. Lastly, please do not call ARRL Headquarters to
>report issues you are having with LoTW. You can contact support at
>LoTW-help@arrl.org.
>
>Through the end of the year, you may experience planned times when
>LoTW will be unavailable. We have been using this time to evaluate
>operational and infrastructure improvements we would like to make to
>LoTW. Those times will be announced.
>
>We appreciate your patience as we worked through the challenges keeping
>LoTW from returning to service. We know the importance of LoTW to
>our members, and to the tens of thousands of LoTW users who are not
>ARRL members. LoTW, just behind QST, is our second most popular ARRL
>benefit.[^1]
