Applications are now being accepted for campers interested in attending
the 2025 Youth on the Air Camp. Licensed amateur radio operators, ages
15 through 25, who want to attend are encouraged to apply online at
[YouthOnTheAir.org](https://youthontheair.org/). The camp is scheduled
to take place June 15--20, 2025, in Thornton (Denver), Colorado and the
[Denver Radio Club](https://w0tx.org/), an ARRL Affiliated Club, is the
local host.

The current application period is for the fifth camp for young amateur
radio operators in North, Central, and South America. **For the best
chance at being selected, applications should be submitted by 2359Z on
January 15, 2025.** Campers will be selected by the working group and
notified by February 1.

To encourage attendance from across the Americas, allocations for
campers are being held open for various areas of North, Central, and
South America. If countries do not use their allocation or should
someone within an allocation decline acceptance, those positions will be
filled from the remaining pool of applicants. As this will be an ongoing
process, everyone will not receive notification of acceptance at the
same time. Preference will be given to first-time attendees.

Applications will continue to be accepted through May 1 and up to 50
campers will be accepted. The application process is free, but a $100
USD deposit is required upon acceptance. Should a potential camper be
unable to pay the $100 deposit, they may apply for a scholarship or
waiver. Campers are also responsible for their own arrival and departure
transportation to the camp location. Travel assistance may also be
available, especially for those traveling from outside of the USA and
Canada. Travel during camp events is provided.

For details about the camp, visit the camp web [site] at
[YouthOnTheAir.org](https://youthontheair.org/) or email Camp Director
Neil Rapp, WB9VPG, at director@youthontheair.org.
