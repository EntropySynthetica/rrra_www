### Introduction to the article

>Every night thousands of men retreat to radio stations elaborately
>outfitted in suburban basements or tucked into closets of city
>apartments to talk to local friends or to strangers on the other side
>of the world. They communicate by speaking into a microphone, tapping
>out Morse code on a telegraph key, or typing at the keyboard of a
>teletypewriter. In the Internet age, instantaneous, long-distance,
>person-to-person communication seems ordinary. But amateur radio
>operators have been completing such contacts since the 1910s. The
>hobbyists often called “hams” initially turned to radio for
>technical challenges and thrills. As the original form of wireless
>technology became more reliable and commonplace in the 1930s, ham radio
>continued as a leisure activity. Hams formed a community through the
>same general practices of other social groups. They set conditions for
>membership, established rules of conduct, taught values, and developed
>a specialized vocabulary known only to insiders. What made hams’
>culture different was its basis in technology. In her book “Ham
>Radio’s Technical Culture,” ... historian of science and technology
>Kristen Haring draws on a wealth of personal accounts found in radio
>magazines and newsletters and from technical manuals, trade journals,
>and government documents to illustrate how ham radio culture rippled
>through hobbyists’ lives. [^1]
