On March 15, 2024, ARRL News announced the 2024 ARRL Field Day Theme:
[Be Radio Active]({{< relref "/post/2024/field-day-theme-announced.md" >}})
<!--more-->

>The theme for 2024 ARRL Field Day is "Be Radio Active." The event
>will run on June 22 - 23, and it will be one-part contest, one-part
>emergency communications exercise, and one-part open house -- and a
>great time. The theme encourages radio amateurs to take advantage of
>the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which we are nearing. Activity this year is
>likely to be extremely high thanks to favorable solar conditions. The
>upper HF bands, such as 15 and 10 meters, should benefit most from the
>Cycle's peak. [^1]
