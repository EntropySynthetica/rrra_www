The 
[July RRRA Meeting]({{< relref "/calendar/2024/july-meeting.md" >}})
is your opportunity to get out and experience portable operations 
rather than sit through yet another slide presentation.

Enjoy an interactive experience, *eyeball QSOs*, and ***maybe*** some
dessert; no club business will be be discusssed at this meeting!

We will meet at the
[Sabin, MN, City Park](https://goo.gl/maps/3LZgFLksDvk)
on Tuesday, July 16th, beginning at
5pm. There will be no formal presentation; attendees are welcome to stop
by anytime between 5pm and 8:30pm.

Feel free to bring your own gear if you wish to join in some portable
ham radio fun!
