There’s a good article in the July/August 2024 [issue] of
[On the Air](https://www.arrl.org/on-the-air-magazine),
ARRL’s magazine geared toward new hams, that offers advice on learning
the Morse Code.
<!--more-->

I’m all for this. I love Morse Code, and it’s still a useful (and
fun!) skill that all hams should have at least ~~a minimal working
knowledge of~~ an appreciation for. [^1]

[^1]: Thanks to David Patton, for [helping me](https://dmv.community/@dcpatton/112779643174604140) to refine my position here. 

The author, [TJ Johnson \(K9KJ\)](https://k9kj.com/), offers a
straightforward (and exactly correct) approach for learning the Code:

1. Learn the characters.
1. Add complexity.
1. Increase speed.

He also includes this **extremely** valuable advice:

* Use Farnsworth spacing.
* Learn the *sounds* of the characters, not the "dots and dashes"

And this is where things get dicey.

The article is accompanied by this visualization of the letters
and numbers:

{{< figure src="https://cdn.some.pics/mihobu/66928a1d5f54e.jpg" caption="Letters and numbers, shown in \"dots and dashes\"` representation of Morse Code" >}}

I’m assuming that this is an editorial choice on the part of the
publisher and not the doing of the Mr Johnson, since he actually goes
out of his way to advise readers NOT to think about the "dots and
dashes." Unfortunately, it will likely reinforce in some people’s
minds that they should make a visual connection between what they here
and what it means. This is highly detrimental to learning any language,
not just Morse Code.

While it’s a tempting artistic device, the dots and dashes really are
not useful to learning the Code. We need to let go of them altogether. [^2]

[^2]: Previously used the word "abandon" here, but I think "let go" better captures my intended sentiment.
