Yesterday, our club---[ARROW](https://www.w8rp.org/)---held its
annual holiday get-together. We had a great turnout, and it was a lot of
fun. It’s a really great club, and I’m really happy to be a part of
it.

The agenda for yesterday’s meeting included:

* Eat pizza. (The club sprang for pizza and beverages.)
* "Elect" next year’s officers. There were no contested elections
this year, so someone moved that we approve the slate presented by
acclamation, and after a second, we did just that.
* Recap of 2024 activities.
* Take a peek at some 2025 activities.
* Hold a “white elephant” gift exchange.

## 2024 was a good year

James, AE8JF, recapped our 2024 activities. They included:

1. Active mailing list in place of a newsletter. No newsletter means
that we don’t have to twist anyone’s arm to be the newsletter
editor.
1. Weekly 2-meter club nets.
1. AMPTeam outings each month. AMP stands for ARROW Mobile and Portable
and they’re kind of like POTA activations and mini Field Days, but
people bring all kinds of different stuff to them. The crazy people in
our club even meet in the winter months.
1. Monthly breakfasts at local greasy spoon.
1. Fox Hunts
1. Communication support for two bike tours: One Helluva Ride and Tour de Cure.
1. Bus to the Dayton Hamvention. For more than ten years, our club has
rented a bus and taken members and others to Dayton.
1. Multiple training sessions and presentations. Every month, we have a
techical presentation at our meetings.
1. Two one-day Tech classes in 2024, with a total of 50 students.
1. 14 VE test sessions that gave exams to 99 candidates.
1. Great showing in the Summer ARRL Field Day. In 2024, our club
finished first in class 4A in Michigan, and nationally, we ranked 43 out
of 4,319 entries overall regardless of class.
1. Participation in community tech events, including the Ann Arbor
Library Creativity and Making Expo and the Maker Works Open House.
1. Participated in Jamboree on the Air (JOTA)
1. Made several repeater upgrades.
1. Obtained ARRL equipment/property insurance.
1. Awarded ARRL special service club award status.

## Keep it fun

I think that one of the keys to our success is offering a wide variety
of activities and encouraging members to participate in those activities
that appeal to them. We encourage everyone to do their own thing.

I’m not big on fox hunts, but I do enjoy teaching classes and
exhibiting at community events. Our technical coordinator does a great
job with the repeaters, but he’s not one of our VEs. The VEs are
committed to holding monthly test sessions and supporting my one-day
Tech classes, but they may not show up for Jamboree on the Air. The wide
variety of activities keeps it fun for everyone.

One result of this is that we haven’t found it hard to fill club
leadership positions. When someone decides that they have had enough,
someone else steps up to fill the position. I think that’s a very good
sign.

Currently, ARROW has more than 160 paid members. And we’re not all old
guys, either. Our youngest member is 13, and we have many in their 30s
and 40s. We even have a few women, too! Like I said, it takes all kinds
to have a successful amateur radio club.
