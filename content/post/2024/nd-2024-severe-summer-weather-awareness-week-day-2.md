### Tornado Safety Tips

If in a building, go to the basement if one is available. Get under the
stairs or a piece of sturdy furniture. If there is no basement, get
to the innermost room on the lowest level, putting as many walls as
possible between you and the outside. Protect your head, neck and spine.

Stay away from windows! Avoid seeking shelter in gymnasiums or large
auditoriums.

If in a mobile home, seek a storm shelter or a nearby permanent
building. Have a plan! ***40% of tornado deaths occur in mobile
homes***.

If you are outside and cannot get inside a sturdy structure, lay down in
a ditch or low lying area (beware of possible flooding).

When driving, if a tornado is spotted in the distance, stay calm and
drive away from it. However, in heavy traffic, never try to outrun a
tornado. Seek shelter in a sturdy building. If no building is available,
lay down in a ditch or low lying area.
