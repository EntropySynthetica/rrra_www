REDDING, Calif. — The Northstate is no stranger to disasters or bad
reception, but when a phone call isn’t able to go through, a ham radio
may just be able to get you the help you need.
<!--more-->

“I’m up east of Redding and when the phone system goes out, we
don’t have a connection to 911 but the ham radio still works and I
can get a hold of somebody somewhere,” said Bob Frampton Secretary of
[Western Amateur Radio Repeater and Echolink Association Inc][warrea].
otherwise known as WARREA.

In the age of phones and Wi-Fi, some can take the ease of connecting to
the rest of the world for granted, but head even 20 minutes into the
mountains from cities like [Redding][redding], [Red Bluff][bluff], and
[Chico][chico], and you'll quickly lose cell phone service.

“Cell phone service up here, especially when you get outside the
Redding area, the developed areas, is spotty at best. There’s a lot of
times where I can get a hold of somebody on the ham radio, I won't get a
hold of over the cell phone,” said Frampton.

With wildfires oftentimes tearing through the Northstate each summer,
there are many people, especially older adults, who may miss the crucial
safety information posted online, but ham radios help close a bit of
that gap.

Frampton recalled times when his radio may have helped people “Fires
come up there and the ham radio operators they’ll get on there and
they’ll start passing information back and forth. You know what signs
have to evacuate, what zones don’t, which way traffic is going to help
get traffic out."

Even if you can’t get in contact with emergency services, ham radio
still allows you to connect with someone who can, and they can send help
your way.

If you're interested in ham radio the [Humboldt Amateur Radio Club][harc] is
offering classes for students to become FCC-certified via Zoom starting
September 9, 2024.
