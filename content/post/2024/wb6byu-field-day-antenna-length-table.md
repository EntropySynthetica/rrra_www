Along with his usual Field Day antenna supplies, Dale WB6BYU brings along a
*handy* table of wire lengths for each band for the antennas he is most likely
to put up. This reference guide eliminates the need to calculate wire lengths
in the field and can be easily shared with other operators who need to build
an antenna.

W6BYU has published a version of his 
[Field Day antenna length table](https://practicalantennas.com/applications/portable/fieldday/fdwiretable/) 
at the
[Practical Antennas website](https://practicalantennas.com/)

## Field Day Antenna Length Table

>All dimensions are for 1mm (AWG #18) bare wire. In most cases, they
>should be close enough for other wire sizes likely to be used for
>portable antennas. There will always be some variation due to how the
>antenna is constructed, wire insulation type, height above ground, and
>other factors, but these should give you a good starting point. [^1]
