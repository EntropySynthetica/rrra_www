By any metric, the New York Marathon is an immense production. The
50,000+ runners who are starting the race on Sunday November 3 make
this the world’s largest marathon. Their route will take them through
all five of the city’s boroughs, from the starting line on Staten
Island up through Brooklyn and Queens, across the Queensboro Bridge
to Manhattan’s Upper East Side, north into the Bronx and then back
down along the east side of Central Park to the finish line in the Park
itself.

Ensuring that the whole thing goes off without a hitch is a remarkable
feat of organization. The race relies on a small army of volunteers, who
do everything from staffing the water stations at every mile marker and
making sure runners don’t get lost to offering medical expertise.

Perhaps more than anything else, though, coordinating an event with
so many moving pieces requires reliable, efficient communications.
Volunteers play a critical role here, too, including one very specific
group: local amateur radio (or “ham radio”) operators.

Donni Katzovicz is a ham radio enthusiast who has volunteered at the
Marathon since 2018 through Event Hams, a group that has coordinated
the Marathon’s use of amateur radio spectrum for the last decade.
He explains that ham radio essentially plays two key roles during the
marathon.

The first is as a route for communications that don’t require the use
of official channels. “Obviously,” he says, “The marathon has
commercial [radio] licenses and [its own communications infrastructure].
You [also] have all the local emergency services—FDNY, NYPD, EMS. The
National Guard gets involved. The Secret Service gets involved. And they
all have their [own] radios and equipment.” a bearded man in a hat

However, he continues, “New York City is a big place. And if
there’s, say, a runner who’s violating the uniform policy, or
who’s holding too big of an inflatable donut, the best use of
resources for the NYPD radio is maybe not to be tied up [handling]
that.”

As well as chasing down people with overly extravagant costumes,
however, ham radio also stands ready to play a second, more critical
role: providing a reliable and resilient backup method of communications
if primary channels go down for whatever reason. Katzovicz says, “If
there was a major failure of all the major, super-critical systems,
[organizers know] that there’s still a backup there.”
