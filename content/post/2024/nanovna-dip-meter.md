### About Dip Meters

*Dip Meters* are known by various names: grid dip oscillator (GDO), grid dip
meter, gate dip meter, dip meter, or just dipper.

>[A GDO] is a type of electronic instrument that measures the resonant
>frequency of nearby unconnected radio frequency tuned circuits. It is a
>variable-frequency oscillator that circulates a small-amplitude signal
>through an exposed coil, whose electromagnetic field can interact with
>adjacent circuitry. The oscillator loses power when its coil is near
>a circuit that resonates at the same frequency. A meter on the GDO
>registers the amplitude drop, or "dip", hence the name.
>
>Dip oscillators have been widely used by amateur radio operators
>for measuring the properties of resonant circuits, filters, and
>antennas. They can also be used for transmission line testing, as
>signal generators, and for measuring inductance and capacitance of
>components. Measurement with a GDO is called "dipping" a circuit. [^1]
