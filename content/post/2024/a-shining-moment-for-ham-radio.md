Shame on us: we take it for granted that someone can speak into a
microphone miles away (perhaps thousands of miles), we can hear them,
reply to them, share information and maybe even get someone some help.

It’s astonishing, but we accept it as commonplace. (Let me remind
you: every time you fire up your mobile phone---smartphone or
otherwise---you’re using a radio). And yet it has the potential for
greatness.

I saw that greatness demonstrated by ham radio in the response to the
devastation brought to Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee
by Hurricane Helene. Torrential rains and high winds wiped out
infrastructure---roads, bridges, dwellings, businesses, power lines,
cell towers---isolating people and putting them in peril ... and
cutting off the affected areas off so thoroughly that people not far
away had no idea how desperate conditions were. It was bad ... really
bad.

The morning after Helene ripped a hole in civilization in Eastern
Tennessee and Western North Carolina, Dan Mark K2DMG dropped his
callsign on the Mount Mitchell repeater (which is fortuitously located
on the highest peak in the Eastern United States, giving it enormous
reach) and asked if anyone needed help ... and that began a saga that
will likely be studied as an example of radio emergency response for
years to come. For hours and then days, Dan---who had never before
been a net control---passed health and welfare messages, summoned
help for people, and much, much more. Others listened to Dan’s radio
traffic and used it to direct help to those who needed it and to find
roads that were open.

In the heart of the affected area, Thomas Witherspoon K4SWL (SWLing
Post’s Maximum Leader) also used ham radio to summon help for others
and provide community communications.

But these few words do very poor service to what really happened. So I
would heartily suggest, recommend, even implore you to listen to the
following videos and podcast.

I think they will boost your appreciation of the potential of ham radio
to do good. I know they inspired me.
