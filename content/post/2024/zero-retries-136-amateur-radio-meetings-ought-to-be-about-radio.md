I'm an accidental Board member of the Mount Baker Amateur Radio Club
and thus I'm part of the planning for future meetings of the club, so
now I'm paying a bit more attention to the relevance of Amateur Radio
clubs and their meetings.
<!--more-->
Thus the following two mentions combined in my mind:

Donald Rotolo N2IRZ commenting on Zero Retries 0135 (emphasis added):

>You know, when I go to the chess club, **we play chess**. At the bridge
>club, **we play bridge**. At the beer brewing club, we **don't** brew,
>but **we do sample and comment on members' beers**. But at the ham
>club, **all we do is talk**. A recent topic at the meeting was "how to
>prepare for being a SK". Wow, that really brought the kids in.
>
>Ham clubs **need to play radio at their meetings**. Solder fumes should be
>common. How to use a multimeter. And so on...

Combine that with
[this quote](https://www.zeroretries.org/about#%C2%A7zero-retries-interesting-relevant-and-interesting-quotes)
I've been citing for practically the entire life of Zero Retries:

The Universal Purpose of Ham Radio is to have fun messing around with radios.
: Bob Witte K0NR

Very soon, this will be *my* primary metric of how useful / fun / interesting /
relevant an Amateur Radio group or associated meeting is:

**Do we... play with RADIOS... at the meeting?**

If *we aren't playing with radios* at an Amateur Radio meeting, we
(Amateur Radio) are not making use of the singular, unique advantage
that we have over every other technical hobby and associated meetings -
**we Amateur Radio Operators** can play, knowledgeably, with *radios* -
and have fun with them.

If, as N2IRZ says, *we're just talking*, then we're doing it wrong.
