Casey Freund of Thermopolis, Wyoming, goes by the call sign KC7E, but
that’s not his TikTok handle. He’s one of the few who don’t need
Wi-Fi or smartphones to keep in touch with civilization. He’s a ham
radio operator.

THERMOPOLIS — Surrounded by the green grass tranquility of Hot Springs
State Park, a temporary ham radio antenna reached into the sky.

Here, amateur radio operator Casey Freund sat in the shade at a park
picnic table along with his ham radio, laptop and portable power supply.
He was ready to communicate on a device that had its start more than
100 years ago, and was essential to civilization before Wi-Fi and
smartphones.

The National Association for Amateur Radio (ARRL) reports that ham radio
began at the turn of the 20th century.

In 1873, James Clerk Maxwell had presented his theory of the
electromagnetic field and, nearly 30 years later in 1901, Guglielmo
Marconi communicated across the Atlantic with a radio device using
high-powered enormous antennas.

With a much smaller antenna, Freund used the same technology that
Marconi pioneered. Coaxial cable was strung from the radio across the
grass to his homemade antenna that extended about 20 feet into the air.
The rabbit antenna, along with his 100-watt radio, can receive and
transmit radio signals from coast to coast and beyond.

“There are calculations you can do to find antennas that work on
multiple frequencies, but they're a little harder to build yourself,”
Freund said. “This is a super easy antenna that took me about 15
minutes to build last year and I measured off the piece of wire that
we're using today to be harmonic to the radio frequency that we're going
to be on.”

Plugging his radio and laptop into his battery pack, a homemade system
housed in a plastic ammo box, Freund was now ready to “key up” which
means “to transmit” in ham radio jargon.

Carefully fine tuning his radio, Freund checked various radio
frequencies for a clear channel catching bits of conversations. He
paused on one conversation which sounded like a long-distance tailgate
party as the men discussed eating crackers and drinking wine from the
back of their pickup truck.

“There are a lot of random conversations going on in nets,” Freund
explained using another ham radio term. For the uninitiated, “net”
is an on-air gathering.

“There's one called the Wyoming Cowboy Net that happens every day,”
he said. “It's all people in Wyoming. They hop on 80-meters at a set
time of the day every day, and they talk on there.”

Freund doesn’t have the capability to join the 80-meter Cowboy Net
since his antenna is a smaller 20-meter set-up. However, his favorite
parts of the hobby are not the conversation. He prefers to ‘CQ’
which means that the radio operator is calling out for anyone to respond
for a quick contact. Freund would then log their signal strength,
location and call sign into his laptop.

### Parks On The Air

Freund adjusted the dial on his radio transceiver, still searching for
a clear frequency. He set up his antenna and gear purposely in the
Hot Springs State Park in Thermopolis so he could participate in his
favorite program called “Parks On The Air”.

“You are trying to get as many people as you can in a short period of
a time,” Freund said. He continued to move his dial in search of a
clear frequency. Static, clicks, beeps and voices reminiscent of Star
Wars characters came over the airwaves.

“It's like a contest, a little game,” he said.

The conversations are quick. Every state or national park has an
identifying park number assigned to it and for Hot Springs State Park
the number is 3299. This system allowed the operators to exchange their
call signs, signal strength, location and radio call sign before moving
on to the next person.

“We call it a handshake,” Freund said. “I hear you. You hear me.
Here's your signal report. Here's my signal report. How well you're
hearing everything. And then the park numbers. It’s a lot of trying to
make as many contacts as quick as you can.”

Freund paused on a static filled frequency and called out, “CQ, CQ is
this frequency in use?”

He asked the question three times. Confident that he had found a clear
frequency, Freund keyed in and almost immediately made contact.

“This is Kilo Charlie 7 Echo at 3299,” Freund rattled off his
personal call sign, KC7E, and the park number.

“You are about a 5.9 in Portland,” came the response which was the
radio signal strength and location.

“QSL. I copy the Portland,” Freund said, which translates to
“I acknowledge your signal report. I heard you say that you are in
Portland.”

“I appreciate it, 73,” the Portland operator said, signing off with
the “73” which is ham radio speak for “Cheers and Best Wishes.”

“73,” Freund said, moving to the next operator and handshake.

The contacts were rapid and within eleven minutes, Freund had made 16
contacts in 10 different states such as Texas, Oregon, Arizona and
Missouri and two Canadian Provinces.

“I'll log my contacts on the computer and when I talk to people,
you'll hear us saying a weird set of numbers and letters which is our
call sign,” Freund said. “For example, ‘Whiskey Seven Romeo Tango
Alpha’ was his call sign for W7RTA.”

### Postcards From Space

It’s not just live contacts that Freund makes through his radio. He
has also captured ‘postcards from space’ and other images that have
been transmitted over the radio waves. One such photo came over his
radio after he had ended his park session.

As a series of beeps and static filled the air, Freund opened an app
on his phone and an image slowly emerged, line by line. Once he got
the image downloaded, he looked up the call sign and was able to
ascertain that the image came from an amateur ham radio operator out of
Pennsylvania.

“They're just sending out a radio wave,” Freund explained. “It
sounds a lot like dial up internet. A lot of the things you'll hear is
actually data that is being transmitted.”

You don’t need a 100-watt radio transceiver to receive these messages
from space. A cheaper handheld radio will capture the radio signals and
a simple app on your smart phone will decipher the image.

“With a handheld and cellphone for a decoder, I can download postcards
from the space station flying overhead,” Freund said. “They do that
probably three times a year.”

### Something For Everyone

Ham radio operators are a diverse group with so many interests that
Freund says there is a niche for just about everyone.

“It's a lot of fun. I do the hobby side of it but there’s also the
prepping and emergency communication. There's the technical sides,”
Freund said. “I know people that they'll build their own radios.”

Freund is so enthusiastic about the hobby that he got the third tier
of amateur radio license called the “Extra.” By doing this very
involved and complex training, he can help other people prepare for
their exams to get an amateur radio license.

A radio operator doesn’t need a license to listen to ham radios, but
the FCC requires anyone speaking on air or transmitting data, to have
their own license.

This license requirement has been around for 112 years when Congress
enacted the Radio Act of 1912 to curb radio interference.

The government mandated that amateurs must be licensed and restricted to
the single wavelength of 200 meters. These tests, Freund said, can be
very intimidating for some people.

“The FCC wants you to know more than you need to know,” Freund said.
“It chases away some folks but we can help you if you are serious
about getting into the hobby.”

For those who would like to take their test, Freund is available at his
website, KC7E.org, to arrange on-line or in person testing. He is also
the president of two growing amateur radio clubs, one in the Big Horn
Basin and the smaller Thermopolis group.

“I tell everybody, get that general license at a minimum, because
“General” gets you on the skip or long-distance radio waves,”
Freund said. “Listening is okay but talking is where all the fun
is.”

He reached over to his transmitter once more, and just for fun, and with
a little fine tuning, he was able to hear a Morse code signal being
transmitted across the airwave. As the code beeped out the familiar
sounds, he said, “Who needs the internet when you have your own
transceiver?”
