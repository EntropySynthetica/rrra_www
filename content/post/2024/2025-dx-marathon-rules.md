## Summary of Changes 2024 vs 2025

>There are a few major changes in the 2025 rules vs those of 2024. These
>are summarized below:
>
>* Two class changes that have been added. The Formula Class has been
>split into two sections. Those that have entered in the past with a 100W
>maximum power output, and a new class for those who wish to operate
>under the same Formula rules but can operate at the maximum permissible
>output allowed by their license class.
>
>* The QRP section similarly exists as last year, however an added class
>option has been added, QRP Unlimited which will allow for any antenna
>configuration with no restrictions.
>
>* In the awards part of the rules, a country plaque providing sponsors
>are found has been added. Heretofore, the highest country score would
>receive a certificate. As sponsors step forward during 2025 with a
>$100 sponsorship fee, countries will be added. As of the writing of
>the rules today, we have secured sponsors for 4 countries, Venezuela,
>Turkey, Slovak Republic, and Chile. We will continue to add countries as
>sponsors step forward throughout the 2025 period.
>
>* In the youth program, we have included another plaque award. There
>will be now a plaque award for the top youth 15 years and younger along
>with a separate award for the top scoring youth 16-25.
>
>* We have emphasized the seriousness of the requirement to have a single
>operating station for entry into the program, i.e. remote stations are
>allowed but second remote stations or remote receiving antennas separate
>from the home station are disallowed. The operating staff of the DX
>Marathon consider violations to this rule as significant and will assess
>penalties if this rule is broken.
>
>* All restrictions in participation of stations in Russia and Belarus
>are removed and they will be eligible for plaques/certificates. Other
>stations may work these countries and receive full credit. Donbas,
>however, beginning with D1 are not legitimate calls and will not be
>recognized.
>
>* Special Note: The United Kingdom has relaxed its location rules for
>some call signs. G0ABC, G1XYZ, M3QRS, etc. can now be in any GD, GI, GJ,
>or GW location as well as G. There is no way to know when this is the
>case and we believe that few stations employ these rules changes with
>the UK. Meanwhile, GD5ABC still must be in GD, MW3QRS in GW, etc. For
>overall fairness, all G0ABC type calls will be scored as G, England,
>regardless of where they are located. [^1]

## About the Annual CQ DX Marathon

>Starting January 1 of each year and running until the end of December,
>the DX Marathon is the perfect answer for the DX-er who needs that
>extra incentive to get on the air every day!
>
>Simply work as many *countries* and *CQ Zones* as you can in each
>calendar year, regardless of the band or mode. Each country and zone
>counts only once, so you can concentrate on working new ones, rather
>than working the same ones on multiple bands and modes. [Find more
>information in the rules](https://dxmarathon.com/rules/2025). [^2]
