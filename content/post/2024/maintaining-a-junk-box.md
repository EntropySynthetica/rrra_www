In this episode of ARRL's monthly On The Air podcast: "Maintaining a *junk
box*---a collection of odds and ends that can be used in future projects and
repairs---is a time-honored practice among hams. Every ham radio junk box has
to start somewhere, though. The cover story of the January/February 2024 issue
of On the Air, *A Fine Mess: Starting Your Junk Box*, by Eric P. Nichols,
KL7AJ, offers advice about how to do just that. The January 2024 episode of
the On the Air podcast digs deeper by going on location to the workshop of
W1AW, ARRL's Hiram Percy Maxim Memorial Station. Station Manager Joe
Carcia, NJ1Q, welcomes us into this working space to show us some
real-life junk boxes and discuss how they come in handy. "[^1]
