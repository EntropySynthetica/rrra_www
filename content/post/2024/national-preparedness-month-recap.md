## About National Preparedness Month

>Since its inception in 2004, National Preparedness Month is observed
>each September in the United States of America. It is sponsored by the
>Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of
>Homeland Security and encourages Americans to take steps to prepare for
>emergencies in their communities. FEMA's Ready Campaign, the correlating
>public education outreach campaign, disseminates information to help the
>general public prepare for and respond to emergencies, including natural
>disasters and potential terrorist attacks.[^1]

Remember, Amateur Radio is an important part of preparedness so we need
to do our part to be ready!
