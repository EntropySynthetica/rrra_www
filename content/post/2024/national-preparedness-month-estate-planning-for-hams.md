**What happens to all your stuff** :question:

Some estimates show that nearly two-thirds of Americans don't have
a plan. For some, it's procrastination. Others don't know where to
start. “So many times we hear from the family of a Silent Key who
are overwhelmed with what to do with a lifetime worth of amateur radio
gear,” said ARRL Director of Development Kevin Beal, K8EAL. “Simply
thinking through what needs to be done ahead of time can prevent the
stress on our loved ones after we are gone.”

ARRL this week held a webinar, hosted by Beal and Dino Papas, KLØS,
to discuss the first steps of planning. “It is something that,
unfortunately, doesn’t get a lot of attention. The bottom-line
up front is, ‘what happens to all our beloved ham gear when that
inevitable day comes along that we become a Silent Key?’...
Unfortunately, that day may arrive unexpectedly – so we need to
prepare ahead of time to make it as simple as possible for our
families,” said Papas.

“Your station is an asset, just like anything else you’ve built and
put resources into. Deciding now what happens when you become a Silent
Key can help solidify your legacy to ham radio,” said Beal. The ARRL
Legacy Circle recognizes the generosity of individuals who have planned
support for ARRL through wills, trusts, life insurance gifts, and other
ways. The [ARRL Legacy Circle][legacy] ensures that ARRL and amateur
radio will continue to thrive for generations to come.
