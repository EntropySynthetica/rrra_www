Morgan County’s independent backup emergency communications network
has been busy making the most of their radio experience and the gift
of two radio towers from the county to build out a secondary layer of
connectivity in case of major disaster locally.
<!--more-->

The incorporated group---Morgan County Emergency Communications
Network, Inc.---will host a Morgan County Preparation Day this Sunday,
November 3 to talk about their efforts and what local households can do
to be prepared for unforeseen challenges.

Their first event, to be held at the South Morgan Volunteer Fire
Department meeting hall starting at 1 p.m., is an informative training
that’s open to the public.

Run by the Morgan County Emergency Communications Network, the event
promises a free emergency "Go Bag" to registered attendees. That will
[include a two-way emergency radio](https://preparemorgancounty.com/free-disaster-radio/)
which could be used if other forms of normal communication with
emergency authorities don’t work.

Network organizer John Petersen said one radio will be given to each of
200 families.

The Morgan County Commission contributed county funds to help pay for
the radios.

In addition to these giveaways, the Preparation Day lineup includes
talks by Petersen, Morgan County’s Office of Emergency Services
Director Jason Hoover, Morgan County Sheriff’s Chief Deputy Johnnie
Walter, Morgan County EMS head Kevin Duckwall, Morgan County 911
Director Marshall Younker and a fire service presenter. Each will talk
about likely emergency scenarios in this area, how those would affect
families and what infrastructure is in place and is important for
community operations and recovery.

Network presenters will include Lori Marino of American Contingency.
She will talk about resources in place for disaster situations and what
households should have on hand to meet the disruptions of an extended
disaster event. John Walton, Vice President of Morgan County Emergency
Communications Network, Inc., is set to train attendees on the use of
two-way radios and talk about communications in an emergency situation.

Petersen said his group, which holds a Memorandum of Understanding with
the Morgan County Commission, is an "integral part of the county’s
emergency response plan."

Made up largely of skilled amateur radio operators, the Morgan County
Emergency Communications Network is "actively building out a
county-wide infrastructure" to add additional communication options
for county residents, responders and those outside the area.

In March of 2021, the county gave the group an unused tower at The
Pines and in June of 2022, the county gave the group an abandoned tower
and building on Cacapon Mountain to use as part of a backup radio
network. County officials also agreed to share space in a planned backup
Office of Emergency Services building with the Morgan County Emergency
Communications Network. Construction of that building has been delayed
by the high cost of bids.

"MCECN exists for those unfortunate times when nothing else works,"
Petersen said.

He pointed to the events in Tennessee and North Carolina following
Hurricane Helene, which created unprecedented and catastrophic flooding
that isolated many.

"[It] should serve as a warning that we must come together as a
community to help each other make emergency response plans—before a
disaster strikes. If we wait until one is upon us, it will simply be too
late," Petersen said.

Morgan County Emergency Communications Network, Inc. is installing radio
repeaters on local towers to enhance radio connections. Petersen said
his network of members can monitor that two-way radio traffic and "act
as an intermediary" between the people and law enforcement or 911 if
needed.

The Preparation Day is meant to get households thinking about their
level of preparedness, said Petersen.

"You need to be aware of the possibilities in order to be prepared,"
he said. "You can’t reasonably respond unless you’re informed."

"When these things happen, if you haven’t thought about it, you’re
already out of time and money and options," Petersen said.
