### About Field Day

This event, dating back to 1933, gives members of the public, and
government officials, an opportunity to see Amateur Radio (AKA Ham
Radio) in action and to learn about the hobby and how it can support
their communities. It also gives Amateur Radio operators an opportunity
to learn about communicating in abnormal situations under less than
optimal conditions by setting up temporary stations utilizing field
expedient antennas and off-the-grid power such as solar or generators.

Social media users may follow Field Day on Facebook and on Twitter using
the [#ARRLFD](https://x.com/search?q=%23arrlfd&src=typd)
hash tag. 

Amateur Radio operators who will not be at a Field Day site are
encouraged to get *on the air* and contact those sites.
