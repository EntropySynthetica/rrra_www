Because of last summer's very successful outdoor antenna event, we are
having a *Bring Your Rig To The Park* event for our next 
[club meeting,]({{< relref "/calendar/2024/july-meeting.md" >}})
from 5--8:30 PM on Tuesday, July 16, at 
[Sabin, MN, City Park](https://goo.gl/maps/3LZgFLksDvk)

Ice cream and pie ***are*** involved, so we'll need a head count. Please
RSVP to the {{< mailto president >}} if you will be attending.

You are invited to bring your rig for others to see, and check out
its reception capabilities, ease of use, etc. We will have at least
two antennas set up, one for portable/QRP/POTA-type rigs, and one for
HF base stations. We will have batteries with Power Poles for the
QRP/POTA area, and AC power supplies for the HF rigs. 

:warning: **This will be a receive-only event.** :warning:

Also for beginners, we'll have other important equipment to demo, such as
antenna analyzers.

If you can't bring a rig, that's OK, come and enjoy a fun evening at the
park.
