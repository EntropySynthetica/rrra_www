## What is it?

>kv4p HT is a homebrew VHF radio that makes your phone capable of voice
>and text communication completely off-grid with at least a Technician
>class amateur radio license.
>
>The radio simply plugs into the USB C port on your Android smartphone
>and transforms it into a fully-fledged handheld radio transceiver. It's
>completely open source (GPL3): the Android app, ESP32 firmware, PCB
>designs, and 3D printer files.
>
>It's small enough to fit in your pocket and take anywhere, and since it
>has no internal battery it's the perfect radio to put in a go-bag or
>your car's glove compartment.
>
>NOTE: kv4p HT is an open source project you build yourself and has
>absolutely no warranty, or guarantees on functionality or reliability!
