:loudspeaker: There will be a Tornado Drill at
[11:15AM on Wednesday April 24]({{< relref "/calendar/2024/tornado-drill.md" >}}).

The tornado drill is a great time to:

* Review your severe weather plan of where to take shelter at home, work, or at school.
* Practice going to your shelter area.
* Ensure you have [multiple ways](#multiple-ways) of receiving a warning. Don't just rely on the siren!

### Tornado Sirens

**Sirens are for ***OUTDOOR*** warning purposes and are not meant to be heard indoors.**

* Hearing a siren is a signal to move indoors and seek additional information.
* It does ***NOT*** mean that the threat has ended when the siren stops sounding.
* Sirens are activated by city or county officials, not the National Weather Service.

Outdoor warning sirens are designed to warn those outside of threatening weather or some other type of emergency. You may or may not be able to hear a siren from within your home, especially when you are sleeping. Also, sirens may become disabled by severe weather.

Sirens are activated primarily by city or county officials. Each city or county can establish its own guidelines for when to activate the siren, such as for severe thunderstorm warnings in addition to tornado warnings. Contact or visit the website of your city or county emergency management for outdoor siren policy.
