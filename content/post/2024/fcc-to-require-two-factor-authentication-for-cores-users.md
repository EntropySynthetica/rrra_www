On March 22, 2024, ARRL News reported on a change to FCC policy which
will nudge Amateur Radio licensing a bit further into the 21st century:
beginning March 29, 2024, multifactor (AKA *two factor*) authentication
will be required to login to the
[Commission Registration System \(CORES\)](https://apps2.fcc.gov/fccUserReg/pages/login.htm).

CORES is the FCC system used to pay any application or regulatory fees,
manage or reset a password on an existing FRN, or request a new FRN.
