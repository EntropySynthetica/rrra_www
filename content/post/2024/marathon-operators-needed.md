RRRA has been called upon to provide aid station communications for the
[2024 Fargo Marathon]({{< relref "/calendar/2024/fargo-marathon.md" >}})
on Saturday, June 1st.

This is an excellent training opportunity for hams interested in
event/incident communications and directed net operations.

Radio operators are needed to support approximately **16** aid stations
and medical drop-out stations.

The course and aid station locations are anticipated to be similar to
those in previous marathons and will be announced on the
[Essentia Health Fargo Marathon page](https://fargomarathon.com/marathon/)---and
through our Marathon Mailing List---once planning and certification are
completed.

General event information is published on the
[Fargo Marathon Event Details page](https://fargomarathon.com/event-details/).
