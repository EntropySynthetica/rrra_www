of the [NTS Letter](https://www.arrl.org/nts-letter), the ARRL
encouraged amateur radio operators to utilize the
[Radiogram portal on the web](https://nts2.arrl.org/radiogram/)
to submit messages to friends and family.

While plenty of NTS volunteers are standing by ready to relay
Radiograms, there's a need from hams to send messages:

>We have had approximately 70 applicants authorized to become
>"radiogrammers" and we are very grateful for their offers of help,
>but they would really benefit from more messages to generate and relay. [^1]

Sending Radiograms helps volunteers hone their skills in preparation for
emergencies.
