***You have to grow with the times or the times will outgrow you.***

That is how my Music Director would sign off from his afternoon radio
show back in the early 70's when I was Program Director at an AM radio
station.

I never would have imagined in 1956 when I was introduced to Amateur
Radio that one day as I left a doctor's appointment in 2024, I could
carry a Ham Radio station in a small backpack and ride my bicycle
less than a mile to a Parks on the Air site and communicate to other
operators around the world. The only way I would have believed that
back in 1956; is if I were sitting with Marty McFly in a Delorean and
a plutonium-powered nuclear fission reactor with a Flex Capacitor
traveling ay 88 MPH and set the date for March 14, 2024.

You might wonder as why I mentioned my introduction to Ham Radio in
1956 and FT8 today. Well, in the early 1950's I remember Ice Boxes, not
refrigerators. Ice Boxes. Several times a week The Ice Man riding in
his mule drawn cart would stop by my neighbor and drop off a large cube
of ice for their Ice Box to keep their perishables fresh. It wasn't too
long in the mid 1950's my neighbor purchased a refrigerator made at GE's
Louisville's Appliance Park.
