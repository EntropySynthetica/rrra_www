### Flash Flood Safety

During a flood, water levels and the rate at which the water is flowing can
quickly change. Remain aware and monitor local radio and television.

#### 3 Simple Steps

:one: GET TO HIGHER GROUND
: Get out of areas subject to flooding.

:two: DO NOT DRIVE INTO WATER
: Do **NOT** drive or walk into flooded areas. It only takes 6" of water to
knock you off your feet.

:three: STAY INFORMED
: Monitor local radar, television, weather radio, internet or social media for
updates.
