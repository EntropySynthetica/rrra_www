The QRP zombies were out and about on the bands last night (October
25th). I got on the air for some of the annual
[Zombie Shuffle](https://www.zianet.com/qrp/ZOMBIE/pg.html). This year
was a little different experience for me from past years, but it was
still fun.

This contest is called a *shuffle* because zombies don’t sprint.
It kicks off at 1500 local time, but I usually don’t work too many
fellow zombies in the first hour. The 40M band is usually my bread and
butter band, however, I made most of my contacts in the first hour on
20M. I kicked things off by working a bonus station and worked about
eight total in the first hour before taking an extended break.

I checked the bands again twice after dark, and it was slim pickings
for me. There was a constant S3-S4 local noise level on 40M, which made
things tough. I managed five more zombies on 40M, but it was rough going
at times. From my RBN spots, I was obviously getting out better than I
was receiving.

I usually pick up a few zombies on 80M, but not this year. Anyway, I
wrapped things up early and submitted my entry to Paul NA5N in time to
watch Game 1 of the World Series.

This year I was again running 5 watts from my KX3 into my
[rain gutter antenna](https://wb3gck.com/2016/12/18/the-wb3gck-downspout-antenna-revisited/).
 During exchanges, I used my zombie name, Bones.

My 13 contacts were a few off from last year’s shuffle, but it
certainly wasn’t my worst year either. It’s a silly contest, but I
look forward to it every year.
