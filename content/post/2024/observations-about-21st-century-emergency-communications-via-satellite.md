In my opinion, the current "best bang for the buck" of
emergency communications capability is to invest in a
[Starlink Mini](https://www.starlink.com/us/roam)
and corresponding Starlink service, and an independent source of power
for it such as the
[Ryobi 18V ONE+ 120-Watt Power Source With 12V Output](https://www.zeroretries.org/p/zero-retries-0169?open=false#%C2%A7new-ryobi-v-one-watt-power-source-with-v-output)
that I discussed in **Zero
Retries 0169**. Turn on your mobile phone’s Voice over Wi-Fi feature,
and as long as the Starlink Mini has a clear view of the sky, and power
(and your billing is up to date), you have a "works anywhere" mobile
phone, text messaging, web browser, apps such as Facebook, weather,
etc. With the Starlink Mini’s Wi-Fi, laptops, tablets, even smart
televisions have Internet access, with enough bandwidth to be able to
share.
<!--more-->

But however useful, Starlink Mini and its accessories is a dedicated
set of hardware, and a subscription, that may not make sense (or
be affordable) to many people. Thus, there really needs to be an
alternative for the folks that have "just a phone" as their
communications lifeline.

In the impacted area, Hurricane Helene wiped out most terrestrial
communications infrastructure --- cellular, landline, and most
impactful, grid (mains) power. Battery backup systems and generators are
just that --- backup, not primary power sources. Battery backup systems
bridge a gap of a few hours, or a few days at most, of loss of grid
power and restoration of grid power. Backup generators can generally
carry primary loads, but require regular refueling and periodic
maintenance. It’s also notable that restoration of all that destroyed
communications infrastructure, especially in Western North Carolina
and that region, may have to wait for roads not just to be cleared of
debris, but in many cases entirely rebuilt. In some cases, construction
of entirely new roads and bridges in a different area as that may be
more practical, timely, and cost effective than restoration of destroyed
roads and bridges. Thus "regular" communications may take weeks or
months to be restored.

## Apple iPhone Satellite Messaging

One of the lesser-told stories in these disasters is the availability
and use of satellite communication features that were introduced
in Apple’s iPhone 14 in 2022, and have since been included in
all iPhones since (not just the high end "Pro" models). When
this feature was introduced, it was solely for "[Emergency
SOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/101573)", but Apple has now
[enabled satellite communications for non-emergency (text message)
communications](https://support.apple.com/en-us/120930). The built-in
iPhone satellite communications capability certainly isn’t as good as
a dedicated satellite communications device such as a
[SPOT](https://www.globalstar.com/en-us/products) dedicated
satellite communicator on the Globalstar satellite network (the same
satellite system that Apple iPhones use) or a [Garmin
InReach](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/c/outdoor-recreation/satellite-communicators/) (uses
the Iridium satellite network). But using those networks require the
(advance) purchase of a separate device, a separate (continuous)
subscription fee, and they have to be with you when you really need it,
and of course, having it charged up and accessible.

Thus, the device that you always have with you --- your iPhone 14 (or
later), that you’ll be certain to grab on the way out the door, is
arguably a reasonable compromise between the lower performance of
the iPhone satellite communications, and the dedicated but higher
performance dedicated satellite communicators.

## Starlink and T-Mobile Special Temporary Authority to Activate Satellite to Phone Capability

While the iPhone satellite communications capability depends on new
radios (or enhanced capabilities of the "radio chips") being built
into the iPhone 14 models and later to access the dedicated spectrum
of the Globalstar satellite network, a partnership between Starlink
and T-Mobile in the US is taking a different approach to use normal
cellphones to access Starlink satellites[^1]. This type of service is
called Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS). T-Mobile is the first[^2]
partner of SpaceX for this service[^3], and T-Mobile has reserved some of
its terrestrial cellular spectrum --- 1910--1915 MHz / 1990--1995
MHz for use on Starlink satellites that have additional radios and
large, focused antennas for providing SCS. Starlink has not yet begun
commercial service (nor received full permission to do so by the FCC)
because not enough satellites are in orbit equipped to provide this
service.

But, there are enough such "SCS" Starlink satellites in orbit to
begin testing and SpaceX requested [Special Temporary Authority
\(STA\)](https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=347020&x=.)
from the FCC to begin that testing on 2024-05-01 for a period of 180
days.

But then Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit, two weeks apart, and without
mobile networks being operational, there are a lot of people that do not
have any communications. They have phones and perhaps ways to charge
them (generators, vehicles, etc.) --- just nothing to connect to.

Thus a new [Special Temporary Authority
\(STA\)](https://x.com/SpaceX/status/1842988427777605683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1842988427777605683%7Ctwgr%5E984a3afe8976fe9201803fbd8b99232be70c64a6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fspacenews.com%2Fstarlink-activates-emergency-phone-connectivity-for-hurricane-milton%2F) for folks in those affected
areas will provide at least minimal services, per this tweet (?) by
SpaceX on X dated 2024-10-06:

>SpaceX and @TMobile have been given emergency special temporary
>authority by the @FCC to enable @Starlink satellites with
>direct-to-cell capability to provide coverage for cell phones in the
>affected areas of Hurricane Helene.
>
>The satellites have already been enabled and started broadcasting
>emergency alerts to cell phones on all networks in North Carolina. In
>addition, we may test basic texting (SMS) capabilities for most cell
>phones on the T-Mobile network in North Carolina.
>
>SpaceX’s direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, so
>all services will be delivered on a best-effort basis.

While the service provided by this STA seems limited to T-Mobile
customers, it’s available for use on any recent mobile phone, not just
iPhone 14s and later, or phones from other manufacturers.

## Satellite to Phone Wireless Emergency Alerts

I was unaware of an even earlier STA that
[Wireless Emergency Alerts via satellite was being tested](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-first-satellite-wea):

While it’s early days for Satellite to Phone technology, it seems
clear that these new capabilities for mobile phone users will be
yet another game changing communications technology, especially the
Wireless Emergency Alert capability. While there is an existing,
robust infrastructure for Emergency Alerts called [Emergency Alert
System](https://www.fcc.gov/emergency-alert-system) that incorporates
notifications via mobile telephone (when mobile phone service is
available), broadcast television and radio, direct broadcast satellite,
streaming television service, and the dedicated [NOAA Weather Radio All
Hazards \(NWR\)](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/) network of transmitters
that can be received by compatible receiver units... those are all
trumped by the one, primary device that everyone has readily at hand in
an emergency --- one’s mobile phone.

Thus this new capability provided by T-Mobile and Starlink:

>[Satellite] Emergency alerts will work for everyone – even
>Verizon, AT&T and other wireless provider customers will receive
>critical emergency alerts.

... answers a long standing issue that for many folks, their mobile
phone is their only communications device. If that isn’t working
because mobile networks are down, they cannot receive emergency
notifications. Thus this new capability of Satellite to Phone Wireless
Emergency Alerts, once fully operational, seems destined to save many
lives by providing reliable emergency alerts, regardless of the state of
the terrestrial infrastructure.

[^1]: Two other companies - [Lynk Global](https://lynk.world/what-we-do/) and [AST SpaceMobile](https://ast-science.com/spacemobile-network/) have proposed Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services using dedicated satellites with large, very high gain antennas. As I read it, both companies have done some testing, including putting prototype satellites into orbit, to validate the concept of dedicated satellites for SCS service, but neither currently has a full plan (including funding) to provide SCS service.<br><br>The biggest difference between Starlink’s approach for SCS and that of Lynk Global and AST SpaceMobile is that Starlink’s satellites also provide Broadband Internet Access in addition to SCS, and the other two companies’ satellites are dedicated to just SCS. In my opinion, the dedicated satellite approach has a hard path to being commercially viable, especially because they will be “leasing” spectrum from mobile carriers to provide their services.

[^2]: Starlink has made it clear that while T-Mobile is the "launch partner" for its Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) service, and Starlink SCS will be exclusive to T-Mobile for one year, Starlink intends to work with other mobile carriers in other countries to provide SCS. There’s nothing unique in SCS to T-Mobile that can’t be replicated by other carriers. I’ll guess that the SCS antennas and electronics on these newest Starlink satellites are flexible enough that it can change bands when over various countries that prefer to use other bands for SCS.

[^3]: Starlink’s satellite manufacturing facility is located in Redmond, Washington, USA. T-Mobile is headquartered "next door" in Bellevue, Washington, USA. It’s not hard to imagine that this idea began over beers at one of the many, many brewpubs in the Seattle suburbs.
