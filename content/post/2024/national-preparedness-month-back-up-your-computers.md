As amateur radio operators, we’re always prepared for the
unexpected—whether it’s a natural disaster, a power outage, family
pets getting eaten, or an emergency communication scenario. This
September, as we observe National Preparedness Month, it’s the perfect
time to ensure that all aspects of our emergency readiness are covered.
One often overlooked but vital aspect of preparedness is securing the
data on our computers through regular backups.

Whether you’re logging contacts, managing digital modes, or
maintaining software-defined radios, your computer is a critical part
of your station. Losing data due to hardware failure, ransomware, or a
natural disaster can set you back significantly. Here’s how you can
make sure your valuable data is safe and sound.

### Why Regular Backups Are Essential

1. **Protect Your Logs and Records**: As radio enthusiasts, we accumulate a lot of data—contact logs, QSL card scans, configuration files for digital modes, software settings, and more. Losing these records can mean losing years of hard work.
1. **Preserve Software and Settings**: Many of us use specialized software to run our radios and interfaces. Setting everything up again from scratch after a computer crash can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience.
1. **Guard Against Ransomware and Malware**: Cyber threats are on the rise, and radio operators are not immune. Backing up your data can ensure you have a clean version to restore, even if you become a victim of ransomware or another attack.
1. **Plan for Natural Disasters**: If your area is prone to flooding, hurricanes, or other disasters, having off-site or cloud backups can help ensure your data survives even if your equipment does not.

### Types of Backups: Which One Is Right for You?

There are several types of backups you can consider, each with its own benefits:

* **Local Backups**: These involve copying data to an external hard drive or a network-attached storage (NAS) device. They are quick, reliable, and allow for rapid recovery, but they can be vulnerable to theft, damage, or the same disasters affecting your computer.
* **Cloud Backups**: Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or dedicated backup services like Backblaze or Carbonite provide remote storage for your data. These backups are accessible from anywhere and are protected against local disasters, but they depend on a reliable internet connection and can come with ongoing subscription costs.
* **Hybrid Approach**: Combining local and cloud backups offers the best of both worlds. Local backups allow for quick recovery, while cloud backups provide an off-site option that ensures data safety even if your entire station is compromised.

### How to Create a Backup Plan

1. **Identify Critical Data**: Make a list of files and directories that are essential to your operations. This might include your logging software database, configuration files, QSL card images, and any custom scripts you’ve created.
1. **Choose a Backup Method**: Decide whether a local, cloud, or hybrid approach works best for you. Consider your internet speed, the amount of data you need to back up, and your budget.
1. **Set a Schedule**: Regularity is key to effective backups. Daily or weekly backups are ideal for most operators. Make sure you automate the process as much as possible to avoid human error or forgetfulness.
1. **Test Your Backups**: A backup is only useful if it works! Periodically test your backups by restoring a file or directory to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
1. **Keep an Off-Site Copy**: If you’re relying on local backups, consider keeping a copy off-site, perhaps at a friend’s house or in a safety deposit box, for added protection against physical damage or theft.

### Practical Steps for Backing Up Your Data

1. **Use Backup Software**: Windows and macOS both come with built-in backup tools (like Windows Backup and Time Machine). For Linux, tools like rsync can automate backups.
1. **Automate the Process**: Set your backup software to run automatically at regular intervals. This ensures you always have a recent backup without needing to remember to do it manually.
1. **Use Strong Encryption**: If you’re storing sensitive data or using cloud storage, make sure your backups are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
1. **Check Your Backup Integrity**: Regularly review your backup logs and run integrity checks to ensure your data is being backed up correctly.
1. **Keep Multiple Versions**: If possible, keep multiple versions of your backups to protect against data corruption or accidental deletion. This can be particularly important if you need to restore a specific version of a file or recover from a mistake.

### Conclusion

This National Preparedness Month, take the time to review your
data backup strategy. Protecting your data is just as important as
maintaining your radio equipment—especially in emergencies. By having
a solid backup plan in place, you can ensure that no matter what
happens, you’ll be back on the airwaves with minimal disruption.

Remember, being prepared means being ready for anything—don’t let a
data loss incident catch you off guard!
