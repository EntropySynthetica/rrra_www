In this episode of ARRL's monthly On The Air podcast: "The Solar Eclipse
QSO Party (or SEQP), is an on-air event coming up on April 8, the same
day as the next total solar eclipse. The SEQP is a great opportunity for
hams to contribute data to studies of Earth's ionosphere, the part of
our atmosphere that makes radio communications possible, and all you
have to do is get on the air and operate as you normally would. The lead
organizer of HamSCI, Dr. Nathaniel Frissell, W2NAF, joins us in this
episode to explain how to get involved."[^1]
