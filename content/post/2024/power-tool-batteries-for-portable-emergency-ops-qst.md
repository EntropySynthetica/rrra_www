In his 
[Power Tool Batteries for Portable or Emergency Operations](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/QST/This%20Month%20in%20QST/2024/07%20July%2024/0724%20Novak%20free%20article.pdf)
article ([a free preview from the July 2024 issue of QST Magazine)](http://www.arrl.org/this-month-in-qst),
Gordon S. Novak, AF5KA, demonstrates how inexpensive DC--DC convertors
can turn easily accessible lithium power tool batteries into a good
backup or portable source for powering a radio.

This is a very timely and topical discussion in light of RRRA's
[July Portable Operations July Activity]({{< relref "/calendar/2024/july-meeting.md" >}}).

AF5KA begins with a brief discussion of the DC--DC convertor specifications to look for as well as two types of battery connections: *ad-hoc* (using ATC fuses) and brand-specific plug-in connectors.

AF5KA then discusses power limitations, provides examples of battery
sizes for different power levels, and mentions the easy-to-remember
rule of thumb: "the maximum amperage to the radio is three times the
ampere-hour rating of the 18V tool battery." [^1]

***TL;DR;*** "Almost any power tool battery will power a QRP radio. An
8Ah battery at 18 V will power a 100 W transceiver." [^2]

AF5KA's article closes with a list of seven power tool battery
advantages and a link to information on where to purchase some of the
parts mentioned in the article.
