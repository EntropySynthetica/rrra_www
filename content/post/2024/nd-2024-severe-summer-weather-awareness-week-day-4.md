### Get Indoors!

On average there are 47 deaths each year in the United States resulting
from lightning strikes. If you are outside and can hear thunder, you are
in danger of being struck!

Lightning can strike as far as 15 miles from any rain falling with the
thunderstorm.

### When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors!

* **STOP** all outdoor activities
* Seek shelter in a building or hard-topped vehicle
* Wait 30 minutes after you last hear thunder to resume activities
