### Things To Remember

#### All Members Should Subscribe To The RRRA List

All RRRA members should be subscribed to the
[Club Discussions mailing list](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra).
This list is the club's primary channel for the distribution of announcements
and is a forum for the online discussion of matters of interest to the club
membership.

#### Mailing List Replies Are Public

When you reply to a message you have received from an RRRA mailing list
your reply will go back to the ***entire*** mailing list; **you will not
be replying privately to one particular sender**.

If you wish to send a personal or private reply you must edit the To /
Reply-To headers in your response.

provides ***self-service*** features for current and potential
subscribers to manage their subscriptions at the time and place of their
choosing. Our mailing lists are not privately controlled distribution
lists.

#### Use Our Groupware To Share Files

Our club's [Groupware system](https://cloud.rrra.org/) was installed to
provide the membership with a *dropbox-like* platform for sharing 
media (e.g. files, photos, etc) without spamming others with unwanted items.

To share a file from our Groupware system you must first upload it and then
explicitly share it:

1. Log-in to our [Groupware](https://cloud.rrra.org/) system and click the
Files icon (the folder at the top of the page)
1. Navigate to the location in your Groupware Files where you want to upload
the file and then click the "+ New" button and use your computer's File
Chooser dialog, **or** drag and drop your file into the browser window
1. After the file is uploaded click the [share
icon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_icon) (to the right of the file
name)
1. To share something with all members start typing *members* in the **Search
for share recipients** box on the right side of the page. Then click
**members** in the drop-down menu. To share something with another user enter
their call-sign in the search box

:information_source: The groups available for sharing include:

* members
* NCS
* ares
* board
* hamfest
* marathon

:warning: Attachments to messages on public mailing lists will be
silently discarded.

#### Use Informative Message Subjects

Make your mailing message stand out from the crowd by using the main
question of your message, rather than a one or two word general topic,
as the subject.

Informative message subjects also help your readers keep track of what each
message thread is actually discussing. 

#### Remember The Mailing List Archives

Take advantage of our mailing list archives if you think you may have
missed or lost some mailing list traffic.

You can find the public archives by starting at our [index of Mailing
Lists](https://lists.rrra.org/), then clicking the name of a mailing
list, and then clicking the archives link in the *About ...* section at
the top of the page.
