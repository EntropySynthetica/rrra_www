<!--more-->

## 1917

Code requirement increased to 10 wpm. Cessation of activity due to WWI
(lasts till 1919)

## 1922

Amateur Radio call signs will now be government assigned. Previously,
hams made up their own call signs (often a person’s initials). The
Amateur Radio service is created with two classes of licenses, First
Grade and Second Grade. First Grade required a written essay examination
and a code test of 5 words per minute. The test was administrated before
a “Radio Inspector” at a Commerce Department Field Office. The
Second Grade license was for people who could not appear at a Commerce
Dept. Field Office. An existing Amateur Radio First Grade licensee would
administer the test.

## 1923

Amateur Extra First Grade license class added. Another new license
class was created, the Amateur Extra First Grade. This license conveyed
additional operating privileges, after passing a more difficult written
examination and a code test of 20 words per minute.

## 1924

Spark gap transmitters banned on newly allocated 80, 40, 20, and 5 meter
bands

## 1926

Spark gap transmitters made illegal on the ham bands

## 1927

The existing Amateur First Grade license is renamed the Amateur Class
license. The Federal Radio Commission created.

## 1928

The Radio Commission starts testing for “Amateur First Grade”
licenses.

## 1932

The Amateur Class license class is renamed the Amateur First Class
license.

## 1934

Establishment of the FCC. License restructuring. Code requirement
increased to 13 wpm. Accurate logging required. Mobile or portable
operation required written notice to the FCC.

## 1939

required to supply fingerprints, photo, and proof of citizenship to FCC

## 1941

## 1945

Amateur license terms are extended from 3 to 5 years

## 1949

Citizen’s Radio Service established (the 11 meter ham band is
reassigned to models and Class D Citizens’ Band radio in 1958)

## 1951

New license classes and names changed. FCC creates the Novice,
Technician and Extra class licenses to join the Advanced (formerly
class A), General (formally Class B) and Conditional (formerly class
C) licenses. Licenses terms were now 5 years except Novice which was
1 year, non¬ renewable. Novices were limited to 75 watts input with
crystal frequency control of CW on portions of the HF bands. Novices
also had CW and Phone privileges in the 145-147 MHz segment of 2 meters.
Ah Novice call signs were 2×3 with the second letter being an “N”.
The Novice test was a 20 question written and 5 wpm CW test originally
administered by FCC examiners. Also, a person could only hold a Novice
license one time. The Technician license as created had ah amateur
privileges from 220 MHz and up (No 6 or 2 meters). The intent was to get
a bunch of people experimenting on the then new (their first use was
during WWII) “UHF” frequencies.

## 1952

FCC stopped issuing new Advanced class licenses December— FCC stopped
issuing new Advanced class licenses and took away unique Advanced and
Extra privileges, everyone General and up had the same privileges (after
changing license classes and rules 1 year earlier).

## 1954

Novice license testing duty turned over to hams. Novice license testing
was turned over to volunteer hams who would administer the code test,
send paperwork to the FCC who would then return a written test which the
volunteer would administer and then send to the FCC for final grading.

## 1955

Technician class licensees receive 6 meter privileges.

## 1959

Technician class licensees are given a portion of the 2 meter band
(145-147MHz).

## 1967

Incentive Licensing takes effect “Incentive Licensing” takes effect,
returning the Advanced class license and taking privileges away from
Generals, effectively stopping growth of Amateur Radio and causing a lot
of bad feelings among the amateur community for the ARRL who originally
proposed the program.

## 1972

Technician licenses are granted access to the complete 2 meter band.
Novices are allowed to use radios with a VFO, and logging requirements
are relaxed.

## 1974

FCC begins issuing “WR” prefix callsigns as part of new repeater
regulations.

## 1975

The Novice and Technician licenses get major changes. Among the changes
are an increase in power for Novices from 75 to 250 watts. Technicians
are also given full Novice privileges on the HF bands

## 1976

“WN” prefixes for Novice licenses were eliminated Effective July
1, 1976, any Extra class licensee who had been a licensed Amateur for
25 years or more could select one specific 1×2 call sign. Effective
October 1,1976, anyone who had held an Amateur Extra class license prior
to November 22, 1967, could select one specific 1×2 call sign.

## 1977

FCC suspends all Amateur Radio license fees. Code sending test is
waived. Effective January 1, 1977, anyone who had held an Amateur Extra
class license prior to July 2, 1974, could select one specific 1×2 call
sign. Effective April 1, 1977, anyone who held an Amateur Extra class
license prior to July 1, 1976, could select one specific 1×2 call sign.
Effective July 1, 1977, any Amateur Extra class licensee could select
one specific 1×2 call sign.

## 1978

Call signs now assigned automatically in sequential order. As of March
24, the FCC will be assigning call signs automatically, in sequential
order. This is the start of the “Group” call sign assignments.
Also, the Novice license becomes a renewable license (following the
example of all other license classes). The FCC stopped (February 23) the
Extra-class only vanity call sign program due to internal mishandling
and maybe some corruption. The ability of a person to hold multiple
station licenses (having multiple callsigns), known as a secondary
callsign, at different addresses is eliminated by the FCC. Instant
upgrades (/AE) allowed. Moving to a new call district no longer required
a change of callsign.

## 1982

VEC created President Regan signs into law a bill that allows the FCC to
authorize licensed hams to create and administer amateur radio license
tests.

## 1984

Amateur licenses go from a 5 year tenn to 10 years. Testing no longer
required to take place at FCC field offices.

## 1987

Novice enhancement. Expansion of privileges for Novices; voice
privileges; a chance to sample HF without a Morse key.

## 1988

Military and commercial use of Morse code ceases.

## 1991

No-code Tech license class created. FCC creates a new Technician license
without a Morse code requirement. This was based on a proposal by QCWA.

## 1995

Vanity callsigns introduced.

## 1999

Three license classes now. The FCC proposes major changes to amateur
rules, cutting license classes from six down to three with a single 5
wpm code test for the two highest classes – General and Extra (new
Novice and Advanced class licenses are eliminated).

## 2000

Highest code test is 5 WPM April 15 — Code speed for General and Extra
license reduced to 5 wpm. No new Novice, Technician Plus or Advanced
class licenses will be issued. Novice and Advanced class licenses can
continue to be renewed. All Technician Plus licenses became converted
to Technician (on the license), but retained their HF (equivalent to
Novice) privileges. In a few years when all code tests were eliminated,
ALL Technician Licensees have HF (Novice) privileges.

## 2005

No more code test FCC releases NPRM regarding the elimination of Morse
Code tests for all licenses.

## 2006

December – Coming just before the end of the year (like the license
restructuring of 1999/2000) FCC releases first a confusing press release
and then a few days later the official Report and Order eliminating
Morse Code testing requirements for all license classes. The FCC also
opens the door for a possible reconsideration of some of the voice
frequency allocations announced just 1 month previously.
