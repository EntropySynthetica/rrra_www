ARRL Straight Key Night will be January 1, 2025, from 0000 UTC through
2359 UTC. This 24-hour event is not a contest but rather a day dedicated
to celebrating our CW heritage.
<!--more-->

Participants are encouraged to get on the air and simply make enjoyable,
conversational CW QSOs. The use of straight keys or bugs to send CW
is preferred. There are no points scored and all who participate are
winners. All authorized amateur frequencies may be used but activity has
traditionally been centered on the HF bands.

Entries for Straight Key Night must be received by January 3,
2025. Votes for "Best Fist" and “Most Interesting QSO” will be
tabulated and included in the results. Send your information to
straightkey@arrl.org or by mail to ARRL Straight Key Night, 225 Main
Street, Newington, Connecticut 06111. For more information, contact
contests@arrl.org or (860) 594-0232.
