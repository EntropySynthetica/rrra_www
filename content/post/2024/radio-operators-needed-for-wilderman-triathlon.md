[ENDracing]( https://endracing.com/wilderman) (Extreme North Dakota Racing)
website.

## Volunteer Needs

Radio operators will be providing communications support to fill in poor cell
service in these planned assignments:

* Amateur radio volunteers at several aid stations (with or without power / facilities)
* Amateur radio volunteers riding with race staff
* Net control depending on participant numbers
* Additional volunteers at several aid stations

## Experience and Equipment Requirements

* Little radio experience is needed
* Operators must have a 440 MHz (70 cm) analog FM radio; communication will be through a temporary repeater
* You must be able to keep yourself comfortable, potentially away from facilities for some hours (e.g. food, water, power, etc.)
* You do ***not*** need to be there the whole time! We will work with your schedule.
