September is National Preparedness Month: an observance *“to raise
awareness about the importance of preparing for disasters and
emergencies that could happen at any time.”* [^1]

[^1]: "National Preparedness Month 2024", CDC, accessed September 9 2024, https://www.cdc.gov/prepare-your-health/discussionguides/index.htm.

There are many ways to take action and prepare before a disaster occurs.
But FEMA specifically recommends these 12 ways to prepare yourself, your
family, and your community to be ready for disasters and emergencies.

Sign up for Alerts and Warnings

: "Receiving timely information about weather conditions or other
emergency events can make all the difference in knowing when to take
action to be safe. Local police and fire departments, emergency
managers, the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and private
industry are working together to make sure you can receive alerts and
warnings quickly through several different technologies no matter where
you are–at home, at school, at work, or in the community." [^2]

Make a Plan

: "[Make a plan today](https://www.ready.gov/plan). Your family may not
be together if a disaster strikes, so it is important to know which
types of disasters could affect your area. Know how you’ll contact one
another and reconnect if separated. Establish a family meeting place
that’s familiar and easy to find." [^3]

[^3]: "Make A Plan", Ready.gov, accessed September 19 2024, https://www.ready.gov/plan.

Save for a Rainy Day

: "Consider saving money in an emergency savings account that could be
used in any crisis. Keep a small amount of cash at home in a safe place.
It is important to have small bills on hand because ATMs and credit
cards may not work during a disaster when you need to purchase necessary
supplies, fuel or food." [^4]

[^4]: "Financial Preparedness", Ready.gov, accessed September 19 2024

Practice Emergency Drills

: "Make a written home fire escape plan and practice at different times
of the day or night getting out in under 2 minutes. Make sure you
have smoke alarms on every level of your home and in each bedroom.
Test them twice a year. Learn the best practices for
[home fire safety](http://www.ready.gov/home-fires) and fire safety with
children." [^5] Visit the
[ready.gov Practice Your Home Fire Escape Plan page](https://www.ready.gov/home-fire-escape-plan)
for more information, including a practice plan.

[^5]: "Practice Your Home Fire Escape Plan", Ready.gov, accessed August 19 2024, https://www.ready.gov/home-fire-escape-plan.

Test Family Communication Plan

: "Communication networks, such as mobile phones and computers, could
be unreliable during disasters, and electricity could be disrupted.
Planning in advance will help ensure that all the members of your
household—including children and people with disabilities and others
with access and functional needs, as well as outside caregivers—know
how to reach each other and where to meet up in an emergency." [^6]
Use the [Ready.gov family emergency communication planning document](https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/family-emergency-communication-planning-document.pdf)
to complete this step.

[^6]: "Be Smart. Take Part. Create Your Family Emergency Communication Plan", Ready.gov, accessed August 19 2024, https://www.ready.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/family-emergency-communication-planning-document.pdf.

Safeguard Documents

: "When disaster strikes, your immediate concern will be your safety and
the safety of those you care about. Once the immediate danger passes,
however, having your financial and medical records and important contact
information will be crucial to help you start the recovery process
quickly. Taking time now to safeguard these critical documents will
give you peace of mind, ensure you have access to essential medical and
prescription information, and help you avoid additional stress during
the difficult days following a disaster" [^7] Use the [FEMA critical
documents checklist][SCDV] to help you through this process.

Plan with Neighbors

: "Talk to your neighbors about how you can work together during an
emergency. Find out if anyone has specialized equipment like a power
generator or expertise such as medical knowledge that might help in a
crisis. Decide who will check on elderly or disabled neighbors. Make
back-up plans for children in case you can't get home in an emergency.
Sharing plans and communicating in advance is a good strategy." [^8]

Make Your Home Safer

: "[Ready.gov](https://www.ready.gov/) has resources to help keep you
safe from disasters like [hurricanes](https://www.ready.gov/hurricanes),
[floods](https://www.ready.gov/floods) and other [natural and man-made
hazards](https://www.ready.gov/be-informed). But are you prepared for
everyday injuries that can happen at home? Every year, millions of
people seek medical attention after they’re injured at home, so it’s
important to know what to do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe." [^9]

to learn about starting your preparedness at home.

Know Evacuation Routes

: "Many states have designated evacuation zones and predetermined
evacuation routes. Learn your state and local plans by visiting your
state and county emergency management websites". [^10] Visit the
[Ready.gov evacuation page](https://www.ready.gov/evacuation) for
information about what to do before, during, and after an evacuation.

[^10]: "Evacuation", Ready.gov, accessed September 20 2024, https://www.ready.gov/evacuation.

Assemble or Update Supplies

: "After an emergency, you may need to survive on your own for several
days. Being prepared means having your own food, water and other
supplies to last for several days. A disaster supplies kit is a
collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an
emergency. After assembling your kit remember to maintain it so it’s
ready when needed: replace expired items as needed, re-think your needs
every year and update your kit as your family’s needs change." [^11]
Use the checklist on the [Ready.gov Build A Kit page]( https://www.ready.gov/kit)
to help you prepare your kit.

[^11]: "Build A Kit", Ready.gov, accessed September 20 2024, https://www.ready.gov/kit.

Get Involved in Your Community

: "Get involved in your community by taking action with FEMA’s citizen
responder programming to help your community become prepared." [^12] Visit the
[Ready.gov Get Involved page](https://www.ready.gov/get-involved) to learn how.

Document and Insure Property

: "Take the time now to think about the priceless personal items you
would want to protect from damage or take with you if you had to
suddenly evacuate your home. The first step is to take an inventory
of your household documents, contacts, and valuables. [Use the [FEMA
checklist][SCDV] to get started]. Then download the Emergency Financial
First Aid Kit (EFFAK) at www.ready.gov/financialpreparedness for more
complete checklists and guidance on collecting and safeguarding this
important information." [^13]
