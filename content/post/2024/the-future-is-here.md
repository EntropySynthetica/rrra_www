Just a week ago I
[wrote](https://ke9v.net/2024/05/07/harbinger.html)
about the rapidly changing future for amateur radio emergency services
due to the growth of wireless internet access provided by the Starlink
service and its fleet of low-earth orbit satellites. Then came dangerous
flooding in remote parts of Brazil. Did amateur radio send in the
varsity squad to provide communication help?

No. But a thousand Starlink terminals were sent to facilitate needed
comms in the worst hit areas.

In another era it might have been ham radio providing that help
and getting the credit for meritorious service along with copious
‘attaboys’ for the world of hobby radio. Instead, Elon Musk is
snagging all those kudos and goodwill.

The takeaway being that “when all else fails” seems a lot less
likely when there is an entire fleet of satellites blanketing the planet
and floating 300 miles above the fray of atmospheric disturbances.
Delivering high-speed internet service to remote parts of the planet
(that could only be accessed by HF radio in the “old days”) is
a game-changer, especially for those ham radio enthusiasts who have
devoted themselves to supporting emergency communications.

That’s not to say that hams no longer have a role to play, that work
just might look a lot different in another five years. And we should
never forget that while the Starlink satellites operate in space, the
corporation is subject to business conditions on terra firma. A major
stock market meltdown could change the trajectory of the service. And
with an eccentric and volatile owner, sudden receipt of news that it was
going out of business would shock few watchers.

Still, it’s a major shift in communication technology and one that
hams shouldn’t ignore. The last thing we need is to appear to be a
bunch of sour old men waving our handhelds at the heavens and cursing
the magic of internet service being delivered from space. We need to
find a way to use this paradigm shift to our advantage (if we want to
continue hitching our wagon to EMCOMM) and that will likely take the
form of using what we’re good at, radio, to fill in the gaps that will
invariably appear in any such technology-based solution.

**The future is here.**
