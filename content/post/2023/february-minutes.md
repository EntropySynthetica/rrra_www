## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports

#### ARES

Brad KD0LDS informed the club of an upcoming preparedness fair by the
Latter Day Saints. Potentially would be a good event to bring the ARES
trailer to. Time would be about 9am-1pm on September 9th

#### Technical

Kirk W0HNV says we are waiting on the weather for the repeater work.

#### Education

Kirk W0HNV states that the classes are going well, they are a bit behind
but that is no problem. Kirk expects the club will have 4 new extras by
the end of the classes.

Jay WS0Y added the general class is starting now. The first lesson will
be posted tomorrow (Feb 22nd 2023), and in a few weeks the technician
materials will be posted.

Kirk W0HNV adds the classes will run concurrently so all the classes can
test on the same day.

#### Hamfest

Anton KC0PFS held the committee meeting on the 14th, where they
discussed alternative venues. Some alternate venues included the TAP
music venue, Shriners, and in future years possibly the Moorhead armory.

The committee met with the Fair board Feb 20th to discuss possibilities
of hosting at the fair. A major change is the fairgrounds will require
any food served to go through their vendor. The RRVF will be remodeling
the Butler Arena, and it will be unavailable for seminars. Other
remodels have been done as well, that will be completed in time for the
next hamfest.

There is a considerable cost increase, previously it was about $900 for Hartl
building, and $200 for the Butler Arena, for 2 days, tables, and chairs.
The price will rise to $1500 for both days, with tables and chairs.

The RRVF may still be the best option for a venue. The tables will
be new, and may not be optimal for heavy radios for sale. The price
increase is notable, but may still be worth it when we consider all the
factors mentioned.

There are 2 presented dates in September: The 23rd, the 4th weekend,
or The 30th, the 5th weekend. The 4th weekend has one other small even
going on at the same time. The 5th weekend has potential to be a busy
weekend. RRRA is guaranteed access for either date regardless, and we
have some time to make a commitment.

Mark KC0SHM asks if we lose the ability to sell concessions, and the
consider the increased cost, how does that affect the clubs profit?

* Last year, we made approx $400 profit on the food.
* Losing that, and the increase of venue cost, our profit would be reduced by $800.
* Coffee and donuts are known to be the best sellers.

A potential for increasing revenue would be corporate sponsorships.
Which could reduce the clubs cost, and ideally increase club profit.
There is consideration of whether or not this increased work would
outweigh doing other fundraising.

Some inter-club discussion occurred about potential venue, and the
general topic was we would need to source tables, and would lose the
ability to back trucks into the venue for heavy equipment. If you find a
venue, please bring that to the club for consideration.

One possible venue is the Shriner's. Gary W0DBL stated that there is a
large Gun Show held there every year, which would not be too different
from a hamfest. The venue has long tables, a sounds system, and vehicles
can drive up to the door to drop off equipment.

Steve K0STK said he would like someone to help for digital signage this
year, and to take it over for future years.

Kirk W0HNV added the food vendor at the fairgrounds requires a $500
minimum, up front. It is a guarantee, and if the vendor sells at least
$500, then we get that money back, and whatever profits are on top of
that. The $500 is a deposit for the food vendor.

Kirk W0HNV also adds that it would benefit the club to reach out and
advertise, and reach out to other clubs in the area. We could ask them
to support and volunteer for the event.

Pete WC0G asked if this could be a *division* event. If it is, then
the ARRL may want to get involved. There used to be a lot of Canadians
that came to the Hamfest as well. We could ask if other clubs in the
division.

The Red River Valley Fairgrounds has us penciled in for both dates
mentioned above, and we have time to choose.

* Motion to allocate $2500 for the hamfest by Mark KC0SHM
* Seconded by Pete WC0G 
* Motion passes

The next committee meeting will be March 14th, at 7pm, over Zoom.

#### VE

Pete WC0G states the testing is coming along, there are some tests after
the meeting tonight. There will be another session scheduled the 18th of
April, to coincide with the classes ending.

#### Media

Steve K0STK asks a favor of the club, if there is an event, please use
the clubs IT assets. If it is an official RRRA event, please have it
published to the RRRA site. If you have any questions, please talk to
Steve, or send out an email to webmaster@rrra.org
