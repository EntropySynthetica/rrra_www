On Monday, May 1, ARRL will launch a survey for members, encouraging their
participation as we consider a dues increase.

The survey will include some short questions about raising dues and modifying
the way some membership benefits are bundled. The survey will also include an
opportunity for members to share their feedback.

The participation of every member is important. All RRRA mebers who are ARRL
members are strongly urged to complete the survey in May.

The survey will open on May 1 at www.arrl.org/take-dues-survey. This is a
member-only page.

ARRL Members need to be logged into the ARRL website to take the survey.
Members who are not logged in may select the Login button on the top of the web
page, and they will be prompted to enter their ARRL website username and
password.

ARRL members who have not logged in since April 2022 should use these
[Login Instructions](https://www.arrl.org/login-instructions).

Thank you in advance for completing the survey!
