>WASHINGTON, November 13, 2023 -- The Federal Communications Commission today
>adopted new rules to incentivize innovation and experimentation in the amateur
>radio bands by removing outdated restrictions and providing licensees with the
>flexibility to use modern digital emissions.  
<!--more-->
>
>The
>[Report and Order](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-amends-amateur-radio-rules-greater-flexibility)
>adopted today eliminates the baud rate limitation---the
>rate at which the carrier waveform amplitude, frequency, and/or phase is varied
>to transmit information---in certain amateur radio bands.  Instead, the
>Commission establishes a 2.8 kHz bandwidth limitation in the applicable amateur
>radio bands.  The changes will enable the amateur radio community to operate
>more efficiently, including in support of emergency situations when
>appropriate, and foster experimentation, which is a core principle of the
>amateur radio service.
>
>The FCC also adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which proposes and
>seeks comment on the removal of the baud rate---sometimes called the symbol
>rate---limitation in the VHF and UHF bands and in the 2200 meter and 630 meter
>bands, which the Commission allocated for amateur radio use after it released
>the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2016.  It also seeks comment on the
>appropriate bandwidth limitation for the 2200 meter band, the 630 meter band,
>and the VHF/UHF bands. [^1]

reacted positively to this decision:

>ARRL President Rick Roderick, K5UR, hailed the FCC's action to remove the
>symbol rate restrictions. Roderick stated that "this action will
>measurably facilitate the public service communications that amateurs step up
>to provide, especially at times of natural disasters and other emergencies
>such as during the hurricane season. Digital technology continues to evolve,
>and removing the outmoded data restrictions restores the incentive for radio
>amateurs to continue to experiment and develop more spectrum-efficient
>protocols and methods while the 2.8 kHz bandwidth limit will help protect the
>shared nature of our bands. We thank Congresswoman [Debbie] Lesko (AZ-08) for
>her efforts on behalf of all Amateurs to get these restrictions removed."
