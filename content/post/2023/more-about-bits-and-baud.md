In this episode of ARRL's monthly On The Air podcast: "This episode ties into
a feature in the November/December issue called *Bits and Baud*, which
discussed important elements of digital communication, namely the quantity of
information a transmission delivers---known as bit rate---and the rate of
speed at which the information is delivered, which is known as baud rate. The
article's author, former QST Editor Steve Ford, WB8IMY, joins us to explain more about the differences between bit rate and baud rate, as well as why hams are concerned with these measurements in the first place." [^1]
