Last call for RRRA members to help set up (and tear down) our
Communications Trailer and represent Amateur Radio at the
[West Fargo 2023 Night to Unite]({{< relref "/calendar/2023/night-to-unite.md" >}}) on Tuesday, August 1st, in West Fargo.

Seth KC0ODE will be picking up our trailer at 1500 and moving it to
Elmwood Park. A few volunteers are needed to help; remember more hands
make light work!

Please contact {{< mailto KC0ODE >}} if you can attend this event.
