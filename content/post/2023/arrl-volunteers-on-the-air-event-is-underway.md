>VOTA encourages participants to make contacts with ARRL members and volunteers,
>earning points for each contact. Point values have been assigned (see the
>Points Table at
>[vota.arrl.org](https://vota.arrl.org/)).
>All scoring is automatically calculated through ARRL's Logbook of The World
>(LoTW,
>[www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world](http://www.arrl.org/logbook-of-the-world)).
>If you are already an LoTW user, continue to upload your QSOs there to
>participate. If you're a new LoTW user, visit
>[Getting Started with LoTW](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/getting-started/).
>
>As part of the event, there will be week-long activations by W1AW portable
>stations operating in all US states and territories. W1AW/# portable operations
>are worth 5 points for each contact, and they can be contacted on all bands and
>modes. There's also an opportunity to earn the W1AW Worked All States Award.
>There will be two week-long W1AW operations from each of the 50 states.
>
>Later in the event, an on-line scoreboard, the VOTA Leaderboard, will be
>activated, allowing each participant to see how their score measures up with
>other participants throughout the year.
>
>Only two-way contacts qualify for points (cross-band, cross-mode, and repeater
>contacts are not valid), using any mode (CW, phone, or digital) - including EME
>and satellite operations - on 160, 80, 40, 20, 15, 10, 6, 2, and 1.25 meters,
