The question *what makes your ham club amazing?* was asked on the
[Amateur Radio subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/)
by 
[/u/ScaredGorilla902](https://www.reddit.com/user/ScaredGorilla902)
and generated a significant level of participation.

The
[replies to this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/11kz8qb/what_makes_your_ham_club_amazing/)
are full of examples of how other clubs provide good member experiences.

Which ones will RRRA adopt going forward?

Who is willing to do more than endlessly discuss the state of affairs at
meetings and actually organize events and activities?
