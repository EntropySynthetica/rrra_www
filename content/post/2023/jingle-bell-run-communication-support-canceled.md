RRRA will not be providing communication support for the
[2023 Jingle Bell Run]({{< relref "/calendar/2023/jingle-bell-run.md">}})
because no one was willing to volunteer to coordinate the radio operators.

Our inability to service existing public service communication
clients could very likely lead to fewer future oportunities
for RRRA to fulfill the fundamental purpose of the Amateur Radio
Sevice defined in 14 CFR Part 91.1 (a).
