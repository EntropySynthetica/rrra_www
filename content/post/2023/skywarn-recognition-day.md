### About Skywarn&trade; Recognition Day

<p class="clear"></p>

>Skywarn&trade; Recognition Day was developed in 1999 by the National
>Weather Service and the American Radio Relay League. It celebrates the
>contributions that Skywarn&trade; volunteers make to the NWS mission,
>the protection of life and property.
>
>Amateur radio operators comprise a large percentage of the
>Skywarn&trade; volunteers across the country. The Amateur radio
>operators also provide vital communication between the NWS and
>emergency management if normal communications become inoperative.
>
>All Skywarn&trade; spotters provide critical weather information
>before, during and after adverse weather strikes. This includes reports
>of rain and snow, ice and wind, storms and tornadoes, flooding and
>fire. This is our 24 hours to recognize all of the Skywarn&trade
>spotters serving our nation! [^1]
