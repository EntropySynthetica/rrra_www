which illustrates that the US FCC's
[restrictions on 70cm operation](http://www.arrl.org/us270)
(listed in 47 CFR &sect;2.106 - Footnote US270)
may be closer to Fargo than some hams realize.

"In the sub-band 420--430 MHz, the amateur service is not
allocated north of Line A" [^1]

According to the
[Industry Canada Spectrum
Chart](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/sites/default/files/attachments/2022/2014_Canadian_Radio_Spectrum_Chart.pdf)
and 
[Canadian Table of Frequency Allocations)](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/SMSE-07-18-CTFA-2018.pdf/$file/SMSE-07-18-CTFA-2018.pdf)
the 420--430 Mhz sub-band is allocated in Canada to ***non-amateur***
use; the primary user is mobile services---excepting aeronautical
mobile---and the secondary is fixed services. 

#### What is Line A?

{{< figure src="//images.rrra.org/line-a.jpg" >}}
<p class="clear"></p>

Line A is defined in
[US Code Title 47 Chapter I Subchapter D Part 90 Subpart A &sect; 90.7](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-90/subpart-A/section-90.7)
as:

> An imaginary line within the U.S., approximately paralleling the
> U.S.-Canadian border, north of which Commission coordination with the
> Canadian authorities in the assignment of frequencies is generally
> required. It begins at Aberdeen, Washington, running by great circle
> arc to the intersection of 48° N., 120° W., then along parallel
> 48° N., to the intersection of 95° W., thence by great circle
> arc through the southernmost point of Duluth, Minnesota, thence
> by great circle arc to 45° N., 85° W., thence southward along
> meridian 85° W. to its intersection with parallel 41° N., to its
> intersection with meridian 82° W., thence by great circle arc through
> the southernmost point of Bangor, Maine, thence by great circle arc
> through the southernmost of Searsport, Maine, at which point it
> terminates.[^2]

### 50w PEP Restriction

Within 160 km (99.4 miles) of 
[Concrete, ND,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete%2C_North_Dakota)
(48&deg; 43' N, 97&deg; 54' W):

>The peak envelope power of an amateur station shall not exceed 50
>watts in the following areas, unless expressly authorized by the
>FCC after mutual agreement, on a case-by-case basis, between the
>District Director of the applicable field office and the military
>area frequency coordinator at the applicable military base. [^3]

This restriction protects the
[AN/FPQ-16 PARCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/FPQ-16_PARCS)
[solid state phased array radar
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_State_Phased_Array_Radar_System)
at
[Cavalier Space Force
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier_Space_Force_Station)
located approximately two miles southeast of Concrete, ND.

The southern edge of this restricted area is an arc which begins in the
west at the Buffalo Lake National Wildlife Refuge near Esmond in ND,
**passes within 40 miles of Fargo through Hillsboro**, and ends just east of
the Seven Clans Casino Thief River Falls in Minnesota.

The effective northern edge of this restricted area is *Line A*.
