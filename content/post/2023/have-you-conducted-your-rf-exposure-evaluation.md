May 3, 2023, was the end of the transition period for the
[new FCC rules governing RF exposure]({{< relref "/post/2021/updated-fcc-radio-frequency-exposure-rules-become-effective-on-may-3.md" >}})
which eliminated previous station evaluation exemptions.

Licensees have enjoyed a 2 year grace period during which they could have
performed these evaluations and made any needed adjustments to their stations.

RF exposure evaluation of ***ALL*** Amateur Radio stations---and compliance
reassessment subsequent to station modifications which could affect
exposure---**are now mandatory**.

Anyone who has taken an exam or renewed their license in the last few years has
had to agree to the following statement (either on an NCVEC form 605 or was
asked a question on the FCC website):

>I have read and WILL COMPLY with Section 97.13(c) of the Commission's Rules
>regarding RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) RADIATION SAFETY and the amateur service
>section of OST/OET Bulletin Number 65 *(OET65 addresses evaluating RF
