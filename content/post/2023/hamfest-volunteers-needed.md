Red River Radio Amateurs needs **YOU** to help their Hamfest Committee
run the 2023 RRRA Hamfest and ARRL Dakota Division Convention.

There are more than 50 job openings to fill which means that we 
need every club member to pitch in. Many of the openings are only for an
hour; but they are all important to the success of our club's biggest
annual event. So please give some thought to how **you** can help out.
