A recent [Pocket-lint blog post](https://www.pocket-lint.com/these-are-the-20-most-common-phone-pins-is-your-device-vulnerable/)
reported about 
[the 20 most common mobile phone passcodes \(AKA "PINs"\) used by mobile phone users](https://web.archive.org/web/20191220145401/https://twitter.com/tarah/status/1134341170400808961)
revealed in 2019 by a cybersecurity expert. This blog post also lists
the most common four-digit and six-digit PINs as determined in 2020 by a
German-American team of IT security researchers.

Users of one of these insecure PINs are encourged to read the
"[How to change your mobile phone PIN](https://www.pocket-lint.com/these-are-the-20-most-common-phone-pins-is-your-device-vulnerable/#how-tochange-your-mobile-phone-pin)"
section of the Pocket-lint blog post to learn how to change their PIN.

## IT security researchers' findings

>Philipp Markert, Daniel Bailey, and Professor Markus Durmuth from the Horst
>Gortz Institute for IT Security at Ruhr-UniversitÃ¤t Bochum conducted a
>study jointly with Dr. Maximilian Golla from the Max Planck Institute for
>Security and Privacy in Bochum and Professor Adam Aviv from the George
>Washington University. They found the 10-most popular four-digit pins as well
>as the 10-most popular six-digit pins.[^2]
