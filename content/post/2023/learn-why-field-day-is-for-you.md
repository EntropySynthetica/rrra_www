### If you don't have plans for your own Field Day operation

You are welcome to join the RRRA Field Day crew at
[the Cass County Highway Deptartment garage in West Fargo]({{< relref "/calendar/2023/field-day.md#visit-our-field-day-site-location" >}})
where the club trailer, along with several other stations, will be set up and
running for the 24 hours of [Field Day 2023]({{< relref "/calendar/2023/field-day.md" >}})

This is a great opportunity for hams who have never operated
in the HF bands to experience this part of the hobby in a *hands-on*
environment. There will be equipment available for use; but you can also
bring-your-own-rig or antenna.

The West Fargo Field Day site will be set up on the morning of Saturday, June
24th, and will conduct operations starting at 1PM CDT though 1PM CDT on Sunday.

Attendees should bring a beverage of their choice---no alcohol---to keep
hydrated and a good attitude with a desire to have fun

***Everyone*** is welcome to visit the
[RRRA Field Day site]({{< relref "/calendar/2023/field-day.md" >}}) for any or
all of the event period. There is plenty of parking available!
