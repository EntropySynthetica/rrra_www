Red River Radio Amateurs has a proud tradition of raising awareness
about our hobby through various
[public service](/categories/public-service) events and
[outeach](/categories/outreach/)
activities---such as the
[Fargo Police Picnic]({{< relref "/calendar/2023/fargo-police-picnic.md" >}})---in
the Fargo/Moorhead area.

But, due to a lack of volunteer support, RRRAES will **NOT** be able to staff
and present the club communication trailer at the 2023 Fargo Police Picnic
**unless** (at least) two more club members step forward to help.

Please contact {{< mailto KC0ODE >}} before My 20th if you care about the
future of our hobby and are willing to help out.
