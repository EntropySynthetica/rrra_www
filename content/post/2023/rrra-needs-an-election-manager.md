RRRA needs an Election Manager for the club's
[2024 Officer Elections]({{< relref "/calendar/2024/february-meeting.md">}}).

Filling the position of Election Manager is a great way for a club
member to make a crucial contribution towards ensuring our club's
continued existence without taking on a long term leadership commitment.
