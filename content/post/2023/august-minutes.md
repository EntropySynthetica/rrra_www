## Regular Agenda

### Standing Committee Reports

#### ARES

Seth KC0ODE reports that [he] and Eric KE0PJR have been working on a
GMRS repeater. It currently has a very small receive range, but about
a 10 mile transmit range. Work will be done to improve the RX side of
repeater.

The Latter Day Saints Preparedness Fair is September 9th, from 10am to
2pm. KE0LDS will be having a class on emergency radio at the fair. Brad
KE0LDS is requesting people to be available to run the table. These can
be broken down into half hour or similar blocks. Brad also would like
a couple people to help run the class. This will be a short class to
present on how radio is useful in an emergency.

#### Technical

Kirk W0HNV reports the UHF antenna at MSUM for the W0ILO repeater has
failed. A temporary antenna is in its place. Kirk has reached out to
vendors for information on new antennas. The plan will be to purchase
the antennas as a club, and hire a company to take the old antennas down
and install the new ones.

The current antennas are very large and weigh over 30 pounds each, and
for safeties sake it will be best to hire professionals.

The Grandin Repeater will be installed likely before the MSUM repeater
is fixed. This work will be scheduled in the near future.

There is potential for a new repeater site in Buffalo ND. We have
also had an offer to use the Sabin water tower for another repeater
site. There is an existing repeater out there that we may be able to
reconfigure. The Sabin repeater site could be beneficial to reach out
towards the lakes area of MN.

Lowest cost for both antennas would be just below $3000. This does not
include approximate $200, and shipping cost is about $400 per antenna.

Andy KD0IOE got another quote, for $3280 for both antennas. Shipping
about $800. Labor to install the new ones and remove the old ones was
$1080. All in this would be about $6347. A couple line items could be
removed in this example. $5,159.64

* Motion to allocate up to $6,000 for new antennas and installation for
the MSUM repeater---with the condition to be as frugal as possible---by
Mark KC0SHM
* Seconded by Seth KC0ODE

Lori KC0GQE asked if there is any warranty or guarantee.

Kent KA0LDG asked if a local company, Mid State, would be a better
choice.

Jake K0RQ suggests we should have Mid State or a local company take care
of this.

* Motion passes.

Kent KA0LDG asked when the other antennas will be going back on the
Sabin water tower after the tower finishes reconditioning.

#### Education

Kirk W0HNV reports there are no classes scheduled. A presentation is
available online that can be used for Hamfest. Kirk W0HNV will be
scheduling an extra class in the near future.

#### Hamfest

Anton KC0PFS reports that some prizes are being donated already. Anton
asks if anyone has anything to donate for prizes to let him know. There
will be an ARRL and POTA presentations. Tickets are already being sold
for tickets and tables.

Important note: this year we are going through a vendor for the food,
so make sure to eat up. We have a minimum of $500 to sell, otherwise we
will be charged. RRRA does not make any money from food sales, but in
turn we do not need to work it. We do not get any profit from concession
sales.

Next Hamfest meeting is Tuesday September 12th via zoom.

Kent KA0LDG mentioned he is the prize guy, talk to Kent for prize      .
donations We are getting a wide variety of things donated already      .

There is some Motorola 'junk' from FM ambulance.

Kent KA0LDG reports there will also be a silent auction from a ham that
passed away. There are some boat anchors, some decent antennas, and
other assorted equipment.

Kent KA0LDG added a note to remind people to volunteer at Hamfest.

Purchase Tickets at hamfest.rrra.org or tickets.rrra.org

#### VE

Pete WC0G reports there will be a testing session. There are details on
the website, and signing up ahead of time is preferred. If you are a VE,
please sign up. Testing starts at 11am.

#### Media

Steve K0STK reports everything is running. If there are any
questions, please contact Steve at webmaster@rrra.org

Steve also reports that the Hamfest sign up form will be available on
the RRRA Groupware.

### Old Business

#### Repeater Antennas replacement

#### Tablets for License Testing

Eric KE0PJR will try and see if Cass County will donate some old laptops
or Microsoft surfaces for the sake of testing.

#### New Sunday Night Net Coordinator

Please contact Jake K0RQ if you can take over net coordinator. Jake will
not be able to continue this role in 2024.

### New Business

#### Hamfest Volunteer Appeal - Steve K0STK

Steve K0STK presented to let us know that every single member needs to
contribute something to Hamfest. This is very important that we have a
successful Hamfest, given that we are spending a large amount of our
savings on new antennas.

Please contact Steve K0STK to sign up for hamfest shifts. It is very
important, and there are many positions open.

The tables at Hamfest this year are not as robust. Please use caution if
you intend to display heavy items.

#### Jingle Bell Run - 12/02/2023

Lori KC0GQE will take care of this and will bring more information to
the club soon.

#### 2023 RRRA Christmas Party

Lori KC0GQE asked the club if we still want to have a club Christmas
party, and if so where at.

Brad KE0LDS adds that schedules get really hectic that time of year,
and there are probably lots of hams that want to go but end up with
conflicts.

Lori KC0GQE adds Fargo Pizza Ranch has been hard to work with, and while
Dilworth is smaller, they are much better to work with. They don't
require a minimum order, just that we let them know an estimate.

Steve K0STK asked if we could try another night than Tuesday.

Lori KC0GQE will reach out to Dilworth Pizza Ranch for dates in the
first week of December.

### Good Of The Order

Kent KA0LDG suggested we find an event for the September club meeting
time, since we will not have a business meeting. On Saturday August 19th
the Brainerd Tailgate Hamfest is 8am to 1pm, at the Crow Wing County
Fair.

Kirk W0HNV added that there is a local ham who is looking to sell
equipment. Please reach out to Kirk if you are interested. Items include
radios, mobile antennas, a hexbeam, and a 15 foot tower he will give
away. Please pickup only.

Anton KC0PFS added that August 25th and 26th is the Ojibwe Forests Ralley.
They are looking for ham radio operators to help with this. This is a great
opportunity to use your radios out in the woods and watch a ralley race from
the best seats in the house
