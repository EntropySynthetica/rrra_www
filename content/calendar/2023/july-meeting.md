Tim K0CRF (and a few other hams) will be demonstrating portable station
setup, portable antennas, antenna analyzers, and QRP operation.

We will meet at the Sabin City Park Tuesday, July 18th, beginning at
5pm. There will be no formal presentation; attendees are welcome to stop
by anytime between 5pm and 8:30pm.

Feel free to bring your own gear if you wish to join in some portable
ham radio fun!
