Tim K0CRF will give an *Operating a Tactical Net* presentation.

Knowing the basics of a tactical net is incredibly useful during high
traffic operations, such as an ARES incident response, as it allows
communication to become more streamlined.

We will meet at the
[Fargo Public Safety Building](/places/cass-county-emergency-management/)
(AKA Cass County Emergency Management or *The EOC*) at 7 PM on Tuesday,
October 17th.
