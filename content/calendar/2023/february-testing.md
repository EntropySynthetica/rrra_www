### After you pass your test

**You cannot transmit until your license appears in the Universal Licensing System
([ULS](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/ApplicationSearch/searchAppl.jsp)).**

Your test results will be sent electronically to the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) through the ARRL Volunteer Examiner
Coordinator (VEC).

The FCC will review your application and, if you qualify, will e-mail a
link with payment instructions for the $35 application fee for an inital
license grant to the address you entered on your test application;
upgrades are not subject to an application fee. You will have **10
calendar days**, from the date of the application file number being
issued, to pay. If you fail to pay within the 10-day window, your
application will be dismissed by the FCC.

After any required application fee is paid, and the FCC has
processed an application, you will receive a second e-mail from the
FCC with a link to their official license or, in very rare instances, an
explanation for why the application was dismissed or denied. The link
will be valid for 30 days. After that time you must
[obtain an official copy of your license from the ULS](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/knowledge-base/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/how-obtain-official).

**You do not have to wait for the FCC e-mail to pay your application
fee.** You can look up your application in the
[FCC application search system](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/ApplicationSearch/searchAppl.jsp)
using your FRN. If you have a pending application in the system, that
means the VEC has submitted your application to the FCC and the fee can
be paid by logging into the
[CORES system](https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do)

[ARRL's FCC Application Fee page](https://www.arrl.org/fcc-application-fee)
