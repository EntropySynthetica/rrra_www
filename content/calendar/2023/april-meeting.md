Jay Goos, WS0Y, will talk about how he became active in
[Parks On The Air \(POTA\)](https://parksontheair.com/).

He will highlight the evolution of his POTA antennas made with parts
obtained from Home Depot and Walmart; such as a furring-strip doublet
with open ladder line; and a vertical made with a bucket, sandbag, PVC
pipe, with a Slinky as a loading coil.

Jay will also discuss the rigs he uses, and how he is activating
in the winter.
