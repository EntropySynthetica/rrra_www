:warning: This is a live event, not training. :warning:

MNVOAD need 8, or more, well trained and experienced ARES operators
from the Northwest Minnesota District (Fargo and Grand Forks included)
to assist with communications, personnel coordination, and general
relaying of traffic.

Due to the nature of this incident, there is the extremely unlikely
possibility that some *unsettling events* could occur. Volunteers should be
prepared for this possibility. 

MNVOAD are requesting a minimum of one week to have time to relay
the information onto the officials coordinating the event on the
reservation.

If you are available to assist please contact {{< mailto KC0ODE >}} as
soon as possible; ideally Noon on Friday, March 24th.

There will be a mandatory hour and a half long online training session
during the week before this incident. A link to the training will be
provided to those who are able to assist.
