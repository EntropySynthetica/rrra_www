This event relies heavily on ham radio operators to keep competitors and
the public safe. Radio operators are needed at the start and finish of
every stage, in service, and at various places along a stage. This year
we will be utilizing a 2M repeater for better communications quality.

In the past, some members of RRRA have volunteered for these events and
enjoyed the opportunity they provide to test 2M communication equipment
and antennas in deep woods.

 This event is a great introduction to the sport of stage rally, as it
is a one-day event, versus some of the longer multi-day events.
