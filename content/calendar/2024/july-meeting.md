Enjoy an interactive experience, *eyeball QSOs*, **and some
dessert**; no club business will be be discusssed at this meeting!

Since ice cream and pie ***are*** involved, we'll need a head count.
Please RSVP to the {{< mailto president >}} if you will be attending.

>You are invited to bring your rig for others to see, and check out
>its reception capabilities, ease of use, etc. We will have at least
>two antennas set up, one for portable/QRP/POTA-type rigs, and one for
>HF base stations. We will have batteries with Power Poles for the
>QRP/POTA area, and AC power supplies for the HF rigs. 

>Also for beginners, we'll have other important equipment to demo, such as
>antenna analyzers.
>
>If you can't bring a rig, that's OK, come and enjoy a fun evening at the
>park. [^1]
