In an ARRL member e-mail dated 19 May 2022 Bill AC0W, ARRL Dakota
Division Director, stated` that this hamfest may be moving to a new
location in 2023 as costs continue to increase at the International
Peace Garden. [2022] may be your last opportunity to attend this event
at the International Peace Gardens.

Lynn W0ND, Peace Garden Hamfest Coordinator, suggests attendees bring a
canopy, screen tent or shelter for registration, presentations, the ARRL
Forum and socializing.

Information about this event is also available on the
[ARRL International Peace Garden Hamfest page](http://www.arrl.org/hamfests/international-peace-garden-hamfest-1).
