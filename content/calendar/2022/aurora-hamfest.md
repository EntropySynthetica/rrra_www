>Aurora, the largest annual gathering of weak-signal VHFers in the Upper
>Midwest, is the annual meeting of the Northern Lights Radio Society. The
>Aurora Conference was first hosted by Jon Lieberg, K0FQA (SK), in 1984.
>
>In the morning hours, the club runs an outdoor antenna range from 0900 to 1130
>(weather permitting). The morning also allows for socializing, show and tell,
>and casual demonstrations. Members are then on their own for lunch. The
>technical programs start at 1300 and typically run until 1700 or 1730. If you
>have a weak signal VHF topic that is of interest to you, or that you would
>like to present, please contact our Technical Chairman, 
>{{< mailto W0ZQ name >}}.
>If giving a technical presentation is not to your liking, Aurora
>also features a poster session.
>
>If you have an interest in weak signal VHF, please plan on attending Aurora!
>You will leave re-energized for this exciting aspect of our hobby! [^1]
