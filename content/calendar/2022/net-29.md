A portion of the
[July 24th Net]({{< relref "/calendar/2022/net-29.md" >}})
will be spent practicing simplex message passing on 146.520 Mhz.

This exercise will commence after check-ins are completed on the W0ILO
linked repeater system. The net will temporarily move to 146.520 Mhz and
{{< mailto KC0ODE >}} will become the NCS for duration of this exercise.

More information about the July 24th Simplex Exercise---including a
description of how operations will be conducted---is available in
[KC0ODE's mailing list announcement](https://lists.rrra.org/pipermail/announce/2022-July/000631.html).
