It's time to start planning for the 2016 ARRL Dakota Division Convention
and RRRA Hamfest. This is the largest Hamfest in North Dakota drawing
attendees from 3 states and 1 Canadian province. Committee members
are needed to plan and run this major fund raising activity for our
club. Lots of volunteers will make the work easy for everyone.

This will be our first Hamfest planning meeting. All RRRA members who are
interested in helping with the 2016 Hamfest are encouraged to attend.

Hamfest Committee volunteers are asked to [subscribe to the hamfest
mailing list]({{< relref "post/2016/hamfest-committee-members-needed.md#subscribing-to-the-mailing-list" >}})
so that they can stay informed and be a part of the
conversation. Volunteers may subscribe multiple addresses
(e.g. work and home e-mail) if desired.

A shared folder is available to committee
members at the <a href="https://cloud.rrra.org" rel="nofollow">RRRA
ownCloud</a> for document sharing and archiving.

Please contact {{< mailto W0HNV >}} if you have any questions about this
event.
