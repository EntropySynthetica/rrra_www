Hamfest Committee volunteers are asked to [subscribe to the hamfest
mailing list]({{< relref "post/2016/hamfest-committee-members-needed.md#subscribing-to-the-mailing-list" >}})
so that they can stay informed and be a part of the
conversation. Volunteers may subscribe multiple addresses
(e.g. work and home e-mail) if desired.

A shared folder is available to committee
members at the <a href="https://cloud.rrra.org" rel="nofollow">RRRA
ownCloud</a> for document sharing and archiving.

Please contact {{< mailto W0HNV >}} if you have any questions.
