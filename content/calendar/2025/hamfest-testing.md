### How to sign-up for your test

1. [Obtain an FRN (FCC Registration Number)](https://apps.fcc.gov/coresWeb/regEntityType.do)
if you don't already have one. You will **not** be able to register
for---or take---your license test without an FRN. Hams upgrading their
license already have an FRN and can
[look it up in the Commission Registration System (CORES)](https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/simpleSearch.do?csfrToken=)

2. [Register at hamstudy.org][register]

3. Pay the [license test fee](#fee). It will be be invoiced separately through
PayPal after step 2 is completed.
