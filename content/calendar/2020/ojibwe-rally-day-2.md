Amateur radio operators are needed to provide emergency communications
for incidents and to provide logistical information to rally officials
when there is no incident.

Potential volunteers should contact N0GQA by e-mail (use the drop-down
menu on the **CONTACT** line shown above).

Radio operators who volunteer will be contacted by phone by the Chief of
Communications to discuss their participation.  No one will be required to
go to a meeting.  Directions will be provided to drive directly to the
assignment location.  A schedule will be provided to allow safe travel from
Park Rapids to the assignment.
