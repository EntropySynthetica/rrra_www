Due to the COVID-19 pandemic it may not be possible for RRRA to operate its
customary collective Field Day site.

Amateur Radio Operators who would like to participate in Field Day
are encouraged to consider operating personal Field Day sites.
And they should monitor this website and the [ARRL Field Day
page](http://www.arrl.org/field-day) for the latest news about this
event.
