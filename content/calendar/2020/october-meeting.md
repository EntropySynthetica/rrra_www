RRRA will not meet in-person this month due to ongoing concerns
about the COVID-19 Pandemic.
{{< /banner >}}

Club members are encouraged to visit the *Committee and Officers
Reports* folder on the RRRA Groupware System (https://cloud.rrra.org/)
to review reports for this month (e.g. September minutes, treasurer's
report) before the meeting.

A public copy of the September Minutes will be published on this website
before the October meeting for the convenience of non-members and those
with issues accessing the club's Groupware system.

An archive of [RRRA Business Meeting Minutes](/categories/minutes/)
(since November 2015) is available online. This link may be found listed
as "Minutes" in the "Categories" list in the sidebar on the left-hand
side of any page on our website (the sidebar is located at the bottom of
the page on mobile devices.)
