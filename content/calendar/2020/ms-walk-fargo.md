>The National MS Society is closely monitoring the latest developments of the
>coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and we are taking proactive steps to
>protect people affected by MS, our event participants and the broader MS
>community. Based on recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and
>Prevention (CDC), we will not host Walk MS events through June in person.
>Instead, we will continue to fuel life-changing breakthroughs for people
>affected by MS through an exciting virtual fundraising experience.
>
>You can still make a difference through ***#virtualwalkMS***:
>
>1. Fundraise: Take advantage of your online Fundraising Center to let
>people know you're participating virtually in Walk MS or start a Facebook
>Fundraiser to let everyone know why this mission matters to you. You'll
>still have access to all the great tools and resources you've come to know
>and love
>1. Build Your Team: Challenge your friends and family to join you---virtually, of course! People with MS are counting on us to do whatever it
>takes
>1. Celebrate Your Walk, Your Way: Whether it's on a home treadmill
>or a walk around the block with your dog, on your site's Walk MS date (or
>whenever it's convenient for you) put on your orange or Walk MS finest and
>show us how you're celebrating by using #virtualwalkMS on social media to
>share photos and more
