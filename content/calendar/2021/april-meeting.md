### MARS Presentation

Staff officers from the Air Force 8th Communications Wing will make a
brief (i.e. 15--20 minute) presentation about the 
[Military Auxiliary Radio
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Auxiliary_Radio_System) (MARS)
program after the RRRA April Virtual Meeting.

MARS is a Department of Defense sponsored
[civilian auxillary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliaries) program
separately managed and operated by two military service branches:

* [Army MARS](http://www.usarmymars.org/)
* [Air Force MARS](https://www.mars.af.mil/)

A question and answer period will follow the presentation.
