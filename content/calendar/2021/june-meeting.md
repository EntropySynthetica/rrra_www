### Important COVID Information

Members who are fully vaccinated (i.e. have completed their course of
vaccinations at least 2 weeks ago) are welcome to attend our meeting without
wearing a face covering. But they should pay attention to official signage
posted in an around City Hall for potential changes to local policy.

Members who are **not** fully vaccinated should follow
[CDC Guidance for unvaccinated people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)---including
wearing a face covering---if they choose to attend our meeting. They
should keep in mind that the CDC considers attending a small, indoor gathering
of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people from multiple households to be a
***Less Safe*** activity.  And attending a full-capacity worship service to be
a ***Least Safe*** activity. 

Members who have a weakened immune system, or who have been recently exposed to
COVID-19, should consider attending our meeting through the Zoom link.
