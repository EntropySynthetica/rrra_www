### About the Community Picnic

>The picnic is an effort by the Fargo Police Department to bring the community,
>local law enforcement, and other agencies together in a casual setting in
>order to educate our community about services available to them in our area.
>
>Join us for an evening of fun with musical entertainment, inflatable games,
>face painting and caricatures. Learn about the dangers of drunk driving and
>riding in a vehicle without a seat belt with the Deutscher Crash Car Display
>and Rollover Simulator.
>
>A few of our picnic attendees' favorite activities include visiting with the
>police K9s, the SWAT, and BOMB teams, and putting out the fire in the fire
>training house with the Fargo Fire Department. Join us to see all the other
>fun booths and activities! [^1]
