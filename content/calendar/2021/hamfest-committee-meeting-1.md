It's time to start planning for the 2021 ARRL Dakota Division Convention
and RRRA Hamfest. This is the largest Hamfest in North Dakota drawing
attendees from 3 states and 1 Canadian province. Committee members
are needed to plan and run this major fund raising activity for our
club. Lots of volunteers will make the work easy for everyone.

This will be our first Hamfest planning meeting. All RRRA members who are
interested in helping with the 2021 Hamfest are encouraged to attend.
