North School Folk House
Doug Swenson
Hawley, MN

Doug began experimenting with a coal forge as a young fellow growing up on a
farm in northwestern Minnesota. This early exposure to blacksmithing led to a
lifelong passion for the craft that he continues to cultivate. Doug's primary
work has been done out of a shop that recreates the time period of 1885 to
1900, but most recently has been focusing on the tools and techniques of
Viking age Sweden.
