> Good evening! This is (**call**) opening the Red River Radio Amateurs
> Sunday Night VHF/UHF Net. My name is (**first name**), and I will be
> your net control operator this evening.
>
> This net meets every Sunday night at 9:00 p.m. local time on the W0ILO
> linked repeater system. It is intended for the passing of traffic
> and in general for the betterment of amateur radio. This is a public
> service net affiliated with the Amateur Radio Emergency Service, the
> ARES Division of the American Radio Relay League.
> 
> This net will be conducted in two parts: a formal portion to handle
> traffic and an informal portion for general comments.  This is a
> directed net, so please address all queries and comments to the Net
> Control Station.
> 
> When checking in, please state your call and your name, and indicate
> if you have any traffic or announcements.
> 
> Is there any emergency or priority traffic at this time?  If so,
> please call (**call**).

After handling any such traffic:

> Are there any mobile stations?  If so, please check in now ...
> 
> Are there any stations on "short time"?  If so, please check in now
> ...
> 
> Are there any stations operating simplex or portable?  Is so, please
> check in now ...
> 
> We begin our regular roll call with stations ...

To provide some variation, it is suggested that the net control
station start with A on even dates and with Z on odd dates.

> A - Alpha through D - Delta
> 
> E -  Echo through H - Hotel
> 
> I - India through L - Lima
> 
> M - Mike through P - Papa
> 
> Q - Quebec through T - Tango
> 
> U - Uniform through X - X-ray
>
> Y - Yankee through Z - Zulu
> 
> Late check ins, please call now ...

After handling all traffic, announcements, and arranging for any
requested informals:

> This concludes the formal portion of the net.  I now open the net for
> comments ...

At the net control's option, either go down the list of check ins asking each
for a comment or do a roll call of stations who wish to comment.

After giving all stations a chance to make a comment:

> This concludes the (**today's date**) session of (**year**).  Tonight we
> had (**number**) announcements and (**number**) check ins.  I'd like to thank
> each of you for checking in this evening.  We look forward to hearing
> you on our next Red River Radio Amateurs' Sunday Night VHF Net.
> 
> We now return this frequency to normal use.  This is (**call**), your
> Net Control Station, now clear.
