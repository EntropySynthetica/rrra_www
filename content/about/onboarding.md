### Help get your RRRA Groupware account set-up { #help }

As an RRRA Member you're entitled to use our Groupware System at
https://cloud.rrra.org/ to access members-only content, share
content with other club members, engage in keyboard-to-keyboard chats, and
collaborate on club related matters.

Please contact the
{{< mailto id="webmaster" subject="Groupware information for " >}}
with the following information:

1. Your FCC call-sign. :warning: **Please append ***YOUR CALL-SIGN*** to
the Subject line of your message.**

2. The ***first name*** you'd like to use as your Groupware display name.

3. **If you paid your dues on-line** ... a copy of your PayPal
receipt to instantly confirm your membership status.

your Groupware account will be held in abeyance until membership
confirmation is received from the Club Treasurer; **this will take
between 20 and 60 business days**.

You will receive an e-mail notice once your Groupware account is created; it
will contain your username and a link you can use to create your Groupware
password.

: such as documents and photos through our mailing lists. Use our
[groupware system] when you want to share files with others.

: (a sort of automatic "reply-all"). If you wish to reply privately
to someone it is your responsibility to edit the "To:" header on your
reply.

: of your mailing list subscription(s). Our mailing list manager
