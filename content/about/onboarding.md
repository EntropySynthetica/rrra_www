### Help get your RRRA Groupware account set-up { #help }

As an RRRA Member you're entitled to use our Groupware System at
https://cloud.rrra.org/ to access members-only content, share
content with other club members, engage in keyboard-to-keyboard chats, and
collaborate on club related matters.

Please contact the {{< webmaster >}} with the following information:

1. Your FCC call-sign.

2. The ***first name*** you'd like to use as your Groupware display name.

3. **If you paid your dues on-line** ... a copy of your PayPal
receipt to instantly confirm your membership status.

:warning: If you paid your dues by mail or in-person at a club meeting,
your Groupware account will be held in abeyance until membership
confirmation is received from the Club Treasurer; **this can take up to
30 days**.

:information_source: **Please use the Subject line "Groupware information
for *your callsign*" on your confirmation message.**

You will receive an e-mail notice once your Groupware account is created; it
will contain your username and a link you can use to create your Groupware
password.

### Subscribe to the RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list { #subscribe }

The RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list is our primary
non-radio means of group communication. Once your subscription is
approved you will be able to start, or participate in, discussion
with all of the other mailing list subscribers by sending e-mail to
rrra@lists.rrra.org

A couple of points to remember:

* You can't send files (e.g. documents, photos, etc) through our mailing
lists. Use our groupware server when you want to share files with others.

* Replies to messages on our mailing lists go to everyone (a sort of
automatic "reply-all"). If you wish to reply privately to someone it is
your responsibility to edit the "To:" header on your reply.

* You are in complete control of your mailing list subscription(s). Our
mailing list manager provides an easy to use web interface which allows
you update or change your e-mail address, control your subscription
settings, and even unsubscribe at will. Please take advantage of these
self service features to manage your subscription(s).

:information_source: **Start the subscription process by visiting
https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra and filling out the form in
the "Subscribe to RRRA" section of that page.**

You will receive a confirmation e-mail message. You must follow the
instructions in that message to confirm your subscription request.

Please provide your first name and call-sign in the subscription form so
that your account is identifiable.

You will need to use your mailing list password to access your mailing list
subscription settings (there are quite a few of them). A password will be
automatically generated for you unless enter one; it will be sent to you once
you've confirmed your subscription.

You will receive a reminder e-mail on the 1st of each month listing
all of your RRRA mailing list subscriptions (you can see index of our
mailing lists at https://lists.rrra.org/), their associated passwords,
and some handy links for managing your subscriptions. Please keep the
most recent copy of these e-mails for reference.

You can always retrieve a misplaced (or forgotten) mailing
list password by visiting a list information page (e.g.
https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra), scrolling to the bottom
of the page, clicking the "Unsubscribe or edit options" button, entering
your e-mail address and clicking the "Remind" button at the bottom of
the member options login page.
