### Subscribe to the RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list { #subscribe }

The RRRA Club Discussions electronic mailing list is our primary
non-radio means of group communication. Once your subscription is
approved you will be able to start, or participate in, discussion
with all of the other mailing list subscribers by sending e-mail to
rrra@lists.rrra.org

#### A couple of points to remember:

:star: We respect our members' privacy

: so your e-mail address will ***NOT*** be visible to other list
subscribers ***unless*** you post a message to the list.

:star: You can't send files 

: such as documents and photos through our mailing lists. Use our
[groupware system] when you want to share files with others.

:star: Replies to messages go to everyone

: (a sort of automatic "reply-all"). If you wish to reply privately
to someone it is your responsibility to edit the "To:" header on your
reply.

:star: You are in complete control

: of your mailing list subscription(s). Our mailing list manager
provides an easy to use web interface which allows you update or
change your e-mail address, control your subscription settings, and
even unsubscribe at will. Please take advantage of these self service
features to manage your subscription(s).

#### How to subscribe

1. Go to the
[RRRA  List Information page](https://lists.rrra.org/mailman/listinfo/rrra)

boxes:
    * You must enter your email address
    * Please enter your first name and call-sign (no slashed zeros)
    * You may choose a password. If you do not choose one, Mailman will
    generate one for you. Warning: Do NOT use a valuable password, since
    this password may be mailed to you in plain text
1. Press the subscribe button. A new page should appear telling you that
your request has been sent
1. You will receive an email message asking for confirmation that you
really want to be subscribed to the list. This is to prevent anyone
from subscribing you to lists without your permission. Follow the
instructions given in the message to confirm your wish to be subscribed
1. After your confirmation is received you will receive a message
welcoming you to the list. This message contains some useful information
including your list password and some quick links for changing your

and some handy links for managing your subscriptions. Please keep the
most recent copy of these e-mails for reference.
