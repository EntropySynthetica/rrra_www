Our club holds
[bi-monthly license testing sessions](/dates/license-testing/)
which are open to everyone.

# What is Ham Radio?

Amateur Radio (ham radio) is a popular hobby and service that brings people,
electronics and communication together. People use ham radio to talk across
town, around the world, or even into space, all without the Internet or cell
phones. It's fun, social, educational, and can be a lifeline during times of
need. 

# Who is the Typical Ham?

Amateur Radio operators come from all walks of life -- doctors, students,
kids, politicians, truck drivers, movie stars, missionaries and even your
average neighbor next door. They are of all ages, sexes, income levels and
nationalities. Whether through Morse Code on an old brass telegraph key, voice
communication on a hand-held radio or computerized messages transmitted via
satellite, all hams use radio to reach out to the world.

# Why should I get licensed?

**Before you can get on the air, you need to be licensed and know the rules to
operate legally.** US licenses are good for 10 years before renewal and anyone
may hold one except a representative of a foreign government. In the US there
are three license classes---Technician, General and Extra. The [ARRL Getting
Licensed](http://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed) page describes the license
classes and provides useful links for those interested in becoming licensed.
