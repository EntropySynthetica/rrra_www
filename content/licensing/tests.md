#### You must obtain an FRN before your test

License exam candidates are reminded that you are **required** to
register in the FCC CORES system and receive a FCC Registration Number
(FRN) **before exam day**. Some remote exam software will automatically
register your FRN if necessary. You should check with your exam provider
to confirm what you need to do.

For FRN registration information and tutorials see item #1 of the
[Exam Session Requirements](http://www.arrl.org/what-to-bring-to-an-exam-session)
and the
[FCC CORES Tutorial Videos](https://www.fcc.gov/licensing-databases/fcc-registration-system-cores/commission-registration-system-video-tutorials).

To register and request your FRN visit the
[FCC CORES User Account and Registration page](https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do)
